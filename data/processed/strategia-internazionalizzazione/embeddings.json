È liche l’informazione elaborata secondo la nostra ma ppa mentale ci facrescere. A volte arrivano informa zionisfida nti (es. della pandemia ) che citrova no imprepa rati (rifiuto).\n## 1. La Piramide della conoscenza Questo modello gerarchico illustra come i dati grezzi si trasformino progressivamente in saggezza attraverso un processo di elaborazione e comprensione crescente. \nom]\n### 1.1. Dati I dati sono la ba se della piramide e costituiscono elementi grezzi, non elaborati e privi di contesto. Sono fatti, numeri, simboli o osservazioni che da soli non hanno significato intrinseco. I dati sono simboli, misurazioni, registrazioni. Sono il \"cosa\" senza il \"perché\": un numero su un foglio, un pixel in un'immagine, un bit in memoria. Di per sé non dicono nulla. \"42\" è un da to. Può essere un'età, una temperatura, un codice, il numero di una stanza, la risposta alla domanda fondamentale sulla vita, l'universo e tutto quanto. La caratteristica essenziale dei dati è che sono indifferenti al significato ed esistono senza interpretazione. Questo li rende potenti (possono essere riusati in contesti diversi) e al contempo inutili da soli. Risponde a domande come “cosa” Caratteristiche: quantità elevata, nessuna interpretazione, nessun contesto.","keywords":["dati","informazione","conoscenza","strategia","internazionalizzazione","knowledge","management","informazioni"],"embedding":[0.015776401,0.0118058305,0.03349397,0.044399805,0.08844667,-0.0041360115,-0.02022344,0.04256452,-0.03134104,-0.0043786573,0.078493774,-0.022341078,-0.057493865,-0.036123373,0.037376307,0.05414094,-0.007932318,-0.02467048,0.012961708,0.059893858,0.078493774,0.047223322,-0.04418804,0.056964457,0.015476403,-0.007844083,-0.036917485,0.008651433,-0.004729391,0.020099912,0.0060396795,-0.02151167,0.044717453,-0.013720528,0.073764384,0.06794088,-0.07044675,0.042670403,0.0050735073,0.015396992,-0.05957621,0.02338225,-0.05128213,0.05269389,-0.007579379,-0.0801173,-0.050470367,-0.033705734,0.050646838,0.038611595,-0.10002309,-0.026099887,0.0040168944,0.056964457,-0.00095734873,-0.0050514485,0.007274968,0.023805778,-0.0036507193,0.057635043,0.031499863,-0.01847639,0.04390569,0.03449985,-0.093034886,-0.0010775689,-0.04418804,0.062364433,-0.07877613,-0.038223363,0.034764554,0.08519963,-0.028835168,0.044929214,-0.008991137,-0.006533795,-0.054776233,0.019394033,0.021564612,0.012608768,-0.011885243,-0.012811709,0.023946954,-0.08788197,0.023823425,0.021088144,-0.046340976,-0.052340947,-0.026258709,-0.03614102,-0.06892911,-0.016773457,-0.09021137,0.05565858,-0.006154385,-0.046729207,-0.007032322,0.022058727,-0.045740977,0.010191132,-0.024529304,-0.046023328,0.03395279,0.010914658,0.045564506,-0.05957621,-0.077505544,-0.019499915,-0.023841072,-0.04754097,-0.071999684,0.0036838076,-0.0035911608,0.0689997,0.016420517,-0.0467645,-0.018176392,-0.043305695,0.028270464,-0.00064576924,-0.011629361,-0.019323446,0.016958749,0.009088196,-0.019535208,-0.00082279055,0.004319099,0.040411588,0.026823413,-0.08054083,0.025694005,0.02168814,0.027158706,-0.0637409,0.006551442,-0.03467632,-0.011973477,0.021846963,-0.0038139538,-0.012899944,-0.000107467364,-0.0022224167,0.006983793,0.040552765,-0.044929214,-0.052940946,-0.02677047,0.037870422,0.0020669028,-0.016041106,-0.0318528,0.024158718,-0.00056911516,-0.030829277,0.043835104,-0.037058663,0.00092150335,-0.020858733,0.0074073207,-0.012044065,0.046588033,0.06278796,-0.011735243,-0.025517536,-0.020311676,0.09769369,-0.019464621,-0.06151738,-0.093458414,-0.04122335,-0.08470551,-0.018811682,-0.060387973,-0.054282118,-0.044470396,0.012732297,-0.005360271,0.018846976,0.0007814304,-0.07404674,-0.083787866,-0.02467048,-0.031252805,-0.040482175,-0.0049102725,-0.007645555,-0.076093785,0.05777622,0.014188173,0.045246862,0.018564625,0.06635265,0.09289371,0.059258565,0.038752772,-0.034129262,-0.020046972,0.006035268,-0.022817548,0.010517601,0.073129095,-0.04895273,0.07341144,-0.090846665,-0.039952766,0.065858535,0.06102326,0.022764606,-0.04718803,0.020452851,0.032417506,-0.030476337,-0.015185228,-0.02332931,-0.069493815,0.026294002,-0.07828201,0.044117454,0.048388023,0.025888123,0.021494024,0.03591161,-0.04087041,0.03179986,-0.075105555,-0.050999776,0.010976423,-0.040376294,-0.010570542,0.005320565,0.05467035,0.04104688,-0.019870501,0.023064606,-0.011938184,-0.026399884,0.021194026,-0.03075869,-0.0051352717,0.055340935,0.011735243,0.006154385,-0.10383484,0.0031433685,-0.01721463,0.05777622,0.0037323367,-0.0072220275,-0.054776233,0.033317503,0.029788105,-0.113293625,-0.00018088156,-0.055199757,-0.04372922,-0.05057625,-0.048564494,0.045846857,0.07595261,0.043411575,-0.030917512,0.029558694,-0.005580858,0.008514669,-0.07182322,-0.024652833,-0.01306759,-0.024811657,-0.041011587,-0.09141137,0.008245552,-0.014664642,0.0353822,0.026382238,-0.094023116,0.022835195,0.0029757223,-0.01157642,-0.008448493,-0.019429326,-0.022605784,-0.03758807,0.083223164,0.06261149,-0.005064684,0.021141084,0.036882192,0.05544682,0.015096993,-0.00280587,0.046340976,-0.06402325,0.07637614,-0.014285232,0.027035177,-0.0649056,0.024776362,-0.01981756,-0.043270398,0.018246979,0.019799914,-0.033458676,-0.0049632136,0.0017492571,-0.06617618,0.034341026,0.0026977824,-0.004405128,0.0009838192,-0.066035,0.046023328,-0.009997015,0.054882113,0.039141007,-0.07291733,-0.026205769,0.08816432,-0.02613518,0.0041801287,-0.05237624,-0.008863197,-0.04231746,0.03492338,-0.078846715,-0.030264573,-0.008267611,-0.089293726,0.042670403,0.027229292,-0.08096435,0.0076852604,0.035170436,-0.04549392,0.046411563,-0.032946914,-0.025376359,-0.02087638,0.055587992,-0.050152723,-0.04461157,0.009582311,-0.02924105,-0.07221145,-0.06345855,0.023188135,-0.028958697,-0.0069617345,0.011426421,0.004848508,0.045529213,0.020541087,-0.039493944,-0.042282168,0.03321162,-0.0029823398,0.021088144,-0.043305695,-0.023541074,0.074117325,-0.0071293805,0.030599866,-0.015414638,0.056223284,0.07743496,-0.018317567,0.023541074,-0.030882219,-0.03234692,-0.011029364,-0.05442329,-0.07729378,-0.0765879,-0.039811593,-0.017726393,-0.019305797,-0.05502329,-0.03882336,0.08576433,-0.010994069,0.019888148,0.05170566,0.012811709,-0.038082186,-0.022852842,0.059117388,0.028393993,-0.046623327,-0.0063882074,-0.050188016,0.00010932857,0.032841034,0.048282143

1.2. Informazioni L’informazionenasce quando i dati vengono organizza ti, struttura ti e contestua lizzati. L'informazione emerge quando i dati acquisiscono contesto e struttura. È la risposta a una domanda implicita. \"42 anni\" tidice qualcosa che \"42\" da solo non diceva. \"Roma, 18°C, ore 14\" è informazione perché colloca un dato in coordinate che lo rendono interpretabile. Gregory Bateson la definiva come \"una differenza che fa una differenza \": l'informazione è ciò che cambia lo stato di chi la riceve, ciò che riduce l'incertezza. Se già sa i che a Roma ci sono 18°C, dirtelo di nuovo non è informazione, è rumore. Un punto cruciale: l'informazione non è oggettiva ovvero dipende da chi riceve. Per un meteorologo, \"18°C a gennaio a Roma \" è un da to anomalo che richiede indagine. Per un turista, è semplicemente \"beltempo\". Risponde a domande come “chi”, “dove”, “quando”. Caratteristiche: dati concontesto, organizzazione logica, significato comprensibile.\n### 1.3. conoscenza La conoscenza emerge quando l’informazioneviene elaborata, compresa e collegata all’esperienza. La conoscenza è il salto più difficile da definire. Non è solo informazione accumulata: è informazione integrata, collegata, resa operativa. sapere che \"l'acqua bolle a 100°C\" è informazione. saper cucina re la pasta è conoscenza.

saggezza include dimensioni che sfuggono alla pura elaborazione dell'informazione: • Etica: non solo \"possofarlo?\" ma \"dovrei farlo?\" • Umiltà epistemica: sapere cosa non si sa, riconoscere l'incertezza • Visione sistemica: vedere le connessioni, le conseguenze a lungo termine, gli effetti non intenzionali • Equilibrio: bilanciare valori in conflitto, navigare dilemmi senza soluzioni pulite È discutibile se la saggezza appartenga davvero alla stessa categoria degli altri tre concetti. dati, informazione e conoscenza sono tutti oggetto di studio dell'epistemologia e delle scienze dell'informazione. La saggezza è un concetto filosofico e morale che risale a i greci antichi, e forse non si \"produce\" a partire dalla conoscenza nello stesso modo in cui la conoscenza si produce a partire da ll'informazione.

La Saggezza presuppone un livello conoscitivo astratto e valoriale che esula da ll'ambito di una specifica applicazione. Il tema è proprio questo: quanto le informazioni che noi abbiamo nella testa e nel cuore ci cambiano l’interpretazione. Le nostre conoscenze influenzano ciò che interpretiamo. 1.6. La parabola dei pannolini e la birra • Dato: acquisto del prodotto. • informazione: aggregando i dati si hanno le correlazioni tra i due prodotti • conoscenza: interpretazione che si vuol da re Decisione: mettere pannolini e birra in scaffali vicini, oppure per ogni pacco di pannolini arriva una birra gratis oppure, metterli lontani così uno gira tutto il supermercato e magari acquista qualche altro prodotto. Avere tanti dati ci consente di avere tante informazioni e tante conoscenze. Con l’AI abbiamo una montagna di dati ed il tema è saperli gestire ed elaborarli. Spesso è qui il problema: dati, informazioni, conoscenza, saggezza sono spesso correlati da un fortissimo legame perché si definisce un’informazione anche in base a delle conoscenze (conoscenze matematiche nell’esempio della galassia di punti rappresentati sulla lavagna) che sono state approfondite; quindi, saper leggere dei dati ed interpretarli presuppone il fatto di avere delle conoscenze. In sostanza è vero che abbiamo un sacco di dati e informazioni ma poi questi sono interpretabili dal fatto che noi abbiamo delle conoscenze. Senza le conoscenze alcuni dati ed informazioni vengono perse.","keywords":["conoscenze","dati","informazioni","informazione","conoscenza","saggezza","strategia","internazionalizzazione"],"embedding":[0.013741478,-0.0019954082,0.084390596,0.005036364,0.093949884,-0.043128822,0.020425512,0.06867005,-0.018689157,-0.030563585,0.052128,-0.06217272,-0.09947635,-0.03530589,0.045369282,0.030600928,-0.022796664,-0.02991012,0.004098172,0.017933002,0.048879333,0.06758716,-0.047796447,0.0545925,-0.017596934,-0.0736364,0.010343449,0.052837476,0.0153097985,-0.015113759,0.010250097,-0.028677868,0.032075897,-0.036052708,0.037135597,0.1005219,-0.06986496,0.045145236,0.006249945,-0.011874429,-0.043240845,0.033662885,-0.019267943,0.039730795,0.047385693,-0.037919756,-0.011585037,-0.024850417,0.035996698,0.060791105,-0.0926803,-0.05059702,0.040925708,-0.0053911027,0.0013792822,-0.024757065,-0.009979375,0.016495375,0.04144848,0.035081845,0.017363552,-0.008028309,0.07569015,0.027520297,-0.127034,0.008098324,0.0033630214,0.05302418,-0.06736311,-0.0430168,0.045070555,0.016747426,0.001320937,0.062471446,-0.023692846,-0.024383655,-0.08812469,0.034671094,0.04760974,-0.019660022,-0.013629455,-0.0356793,0.02451435,-0.049252745,0.020220136,0.0033770243,-0.026549432,-0.034820456,-0.047684424,-0.018082365,-0.03640745,0.009727323,-0.04615344,0.037845075,0.023991575,-0.037527677,0.036724847,-0.02225522,0.0014831368,0.015179105,-0.0023326438,-0.03114237,0.06392775,-0.0008139165,0.030974336,-0.048916675,-0.036463458,0.029443357,-0.031553123,-0.06213538,-0.093949884,0.013638791,0.02417828,0.07221744,0.017223524,-0.06837132,-0.023916893,-0.029779425,0.03726629,-0.003860123,0.0086351,-0.034988493,-0.03995484,-0.021004297,-0.013638791,0.018297076,-0.003143643,0.032131907,0.044473097,-0.067512475,0.07109721,0.014721679,0.053173546,-0.08842342,0.0013524434,-0.082075454,-0.0035450587,0.0059652203,0.0025018451,-0.00095919624,-0.010726195,0.008639768,0.0060118968,-0.029760756,-0.099252306,-0.024701053,0.005097043,0.03190786,-0.013022664,0.015972601,-0.08401719,-0.023114063,-0.021620423,-0.02266597,0.020201467,-0.046190783,-0.084390596,-0.005535799,0.020537535,-0.003738765,-0.010567496,0.053136203,-0.01844644,0.0030362878,-0.037434325,0.08058182,-0.0035450587,-0.011986452,-0.09880421,-0.08319569,-0.08894619,-0.05787851,-0.056198165,-0.025223827,-0.021303024,-0.02345013,0.023394119,0.00015796981,0.0056758276,-0.056982324,-0.06501064,-0.013190699,-0.017186183,-0.046788238,-0.004380563,0.0056758276,-0.076847725,0.047535058,0.055600706,0.024439666,-0.022946028,0.02804307,0.13420345,0.025671918,0.063517,-0.0721801,-0.0059652203,0.01960401,-0.021713777,0.07677304,0.09790803,-0.06769919,0.07595154,-0.065496065,-0.0033956948,0.05100777,0.044025008,-0.020182796,-0.0010665515,0.0049663493,0.053995047,-0.054368455,-0.0027352262,0.04615344,-0.098132074,0.009190547,-0.03502583,0.046937604,-0.0020280816,0.04656419,0.040029522,0.0024434999,-0.020500194,-0.0014026203,-0.04264339,-0.014646997,0.07654899,-0.05336025,-0.0107542,-0.048954014,0.053658977,0.027725672,0.026792148,-0.0011068098,0.023860881,-0.027053535,0.02612001,-0.01346142,-0.040552296,0.04260605,0.021265684,0.059782896,-0.007995636,0.009998046,-0.045369282,0.061575264,0.007748252,0.010026051,-0.076698355,0.027016195,0.0037737722,-0.08909556,0.0063292948,-0.033681557,-0.05993226,-0.05989492,-0.015337804,0.019660022,0.06344231,0.033681557,-0.03875993,0.07916286,-0.059334807,-0.013900177,-0.047348354,-0.025989316,0.027557638,-0.020108113,0.0010513818,-0.07303894,0.02303938,0.00690808,0.0020024097,0.06870739,-0.05268811,-0.017951673,-0.028920583,-0.0069267503,0.006105249,0.022385914,-0.08528678,-0.020500194,0.06691502,0.04070166,0.017933002,0.03259867,0.049700834,0.011557031,-0.0024388323,-0.0015799899,0.02729625,-0.06822196,0.06893144,0.0035473923,0.03500716,-0.036538143,0.044323735,-0.0066093523,-0.08140332,0.061500583,0.06639225,-0.021545742,0.016775431,0.025018452,-0.033102773,-0.008915157,0.018147713,0.013797489,0.017204853,-0.07285224,0.06628022,0.020686898,0.026642784,0.003923136,-0.10724328,-0.051119793,0.055899438,-0.035212535,0.018157048,-0.05485389,-0.013788154,0.008275693,0.0005992059,-0.055936776,-0.015272458,-0.032430634,-0.067512475,0.013853501,-0.0007882446,-0.037191607,0.0077669225,0.048954014,-0.05418175,0.055787414,-0.06262081,-0.0016266662,-0.0016196647,0.0008180007,-0.011454344,-0.046788238,-0.046116102,0.016346011,-0.04533194,-0.07565281,0.024943769,-0.03801311,0.018101037,-0.016887454,0.06310625,0.06583214,0.04331553,-0.058587987,-0.03259867,0.022479266,0.014170899,0.0076315613,-0.052800134,-0.040066864,0.072105415,-0.028491162,0.0373223,-0.027165558,0.079536274,0.10477877,0.0068800743,0.015561851,-0.04271807,-0.04495853,-0.006982762,-0.065496065,-0.042867437,-0.029798096,-0.027893707,0.002987278,-0.055414002,-0.014544309,-0.04731101,0.0721801,-0.020014761,0.012191827,0.056683596,0.0013337729,-0.09484607,-0.01960401,0.06448786,0.036668833,-0.016318005,-0.009428595,-0.022012504,-0.019473318,-0.014170899,0.027370933,-0.022983368,-0.027763013,0

LA conoscenza NELLE organizzaZIONI\n### 4.1 Soft Skills and Innovation Perché la conoscenza è sempre più importante? Andiamo ad analizzare un’analisi fatta nel 2010 negli USA che evidenzia le varie tipologie di lavoro presenti nel mercato del la voro: La voro manua le non routina rio Non-Routine manual in nero. È il cla ssico la voro a rtigia na le. Come si vede dal grafico tende a diminuire ma rima ne sempre abba stanza costante, bassa ma rimane sempre. Il la voro a rtigia na le da quello più tecnologico informatico a quello più operativo del falegna merima rrà sempre. Ciò che ca la in ma nieradrastica è il la voro routina rio manuale Routine manual in gia lloperché l’automazione ela robotica, Industria 4.0 staporta ndo a da utomatizza retutte le operazioni routina rie.

Si distingue dal knowledge flow, che invece rappresenta i flussi di conoscenza, ovvero come il sapere circola, sicrea e sitrasforma all'interno e all'esterno dell'organizzazione. L'esempio Swatch illustra bene questi concetti. Negli anni'70-'80 l'industria orologiera svizzera era in crisi profonda, tra volta dalla concorrenza gia pponese degli orologi al quarzo economici. Le aziende svizzere a vevano un enorme knowledge stocknella meccanica di precisione, ma questo sapere sembra va diventa to obsoleto. Nicola s Ha yek, con la creazione di Swatch, non abbandonò quel patrimonio di conoscenze ma lo ricombinò in modo innovativo. Prese il knowledge stock esistente (competenze nellaminia turizzazione, nella precisione, nel design) e lo integrò connuove conoscenze (plastica, a utomazione, ma rketing dellamoda ).

Approccio Orientale\n#### 5.2.1. Il modello SECI Ikujiro Nonaka e Hirota ka Ta keuchi, nel libro The Knowledge-Creating Company (1995), hanno proposto un modello di creazionedella conoscenza basato su quattro fasi: differenza tra approccio occidentale e orientale • Occidentale - si concentra sulla conoscenza esplicita: documenta re, codifica re, creare da ta ba se e sistemi informativi. La conoscenza è un oggetto da gestire ed è orientato all’efficientismo del “Onebest way” (siamo nel ta ylorismo). • Orientale (giapponese) - va lorizza la conoscenza tacita: intuizione, esperienza, saper fareed è legato al temadelle motivazioni.

Il middle ma na ger ha giocato un ruolo importante rivedendo il paradigma dell’epoca ovvero passare dal modello machine maximun, men minimun (ma cchine di Ha za rdpresta zionali ma scomode) a d un modello uomo nel comfort più assoluto, la macchina a suo servizio (tallboy, a utocorta ed a lta ).

Il passato (1960-1980): l'ambizione di sostituire l'uomo Neiprimi decenni dell'intelligenza a rtificia le domina va un'ambizione a udace: creare ma cchine capaci di replica re, e potenzia lmente sostituire, l'intelligenza umana. L'ideaera che un progra mma per computer, a voltechia ma to \"a gente AI\", potesse imitare il modo in cui gli esseri umani pensano, ragiona no e intera giscono. • Il caso di Eliza. Creato da Joseph Weizenba um al MIT nel 1966, è uno degli esempi più celebri di questa fa se. Il progra mma simula va un terapeuta rogersia no, ovvero uno psicotera peuta che segue l'approccio di Carl Rogers, basa tosull'ascolto empatico e sul riformula reciò che il pa ziente dice per stimola re la riflessione. Eliveera sorprendentemente semplice: circa 200 righe di codice. Non \"capiva \" nulla nel sensouma no del termine. Si limita va a riconoscere parole chiave nelle fra sidell'utente e a rispondere condoma nde o riformulazioni predefinite. Ad esempio: Utente: \"Misento triste\" Eliza: \"Perché dici che tisenti triste?\" Utente: \"Miamadre micritica sempre\" Eliza: \"Parlami di più dellatua famiglia\" Perché fece scalpore.

5. apprendimento Automatico - Machine Learning - ML Il Ma chine Learning è un campo interdisciplina reche integra sta tistica, informatica e ottimizzazione. Le sue origini risalgono a gli anni'50: il termine fuconia to da Arthur Samuel nel 1959, mentre tecniche pionieristiche come il perceptron di Rosenbla ttrisa lgono al 1958. Dopodecenni di sviluppo teorico e a lterne fortune, il campo ha conosciuto una svolta nel 2012, quando la rete neura le AlexNet ha dimostra to la potenza del deep learning nella competizione Ima geNet. Da allora l'a dozione di queste tecniche è esplosa in ogni settore. La componente fondamenta le del ML sono i dati, e il loro utilizzo solleva questioni crucia li: ➢ qualidati servono? La qualità, quantità e rappresentatività dei dati determina no l'effica cia del modello. ➢ Di chi sono i dati? Proprietà, privacy e consenso sono aspetti legali edetici imprescindibili. ➢ Come vengono usati? I dati per genera re report a na litici hanno requisiti diversi da quelli per addestra re sistemi che governa nolinee di produzione in tempo rea le. 5.1 Il principio dell'apprendimento da esempi Il Ma chine Learning sifonda sull'idea di apprendere da esempi per svolgere un compito (task). Invece di progra mmare esplicitamente le regole, si fornisce al sistema un insieme di dati (tra ining set) da cui essorica va a utonomamente i pattern necessa ri.

5.8 Modelli del Linguaggio e IA Generativa\n#### 5.8.1 Il gioco della previsione: come funziona un modello linguistico Un modello del lingua ggio è, nellasua essenza, un sistema che calcola la proba bilità della prossima parola da to il contesto precedente. È come un gioco di indovinelli sofistica to, dove il modello deve completa re una fra se in modo pla usibile. Esempio Da ta la fra se \"L'insegna nte ha consiglia to\", quali parole potrebbero seguire? Il modello calcola una distribuzione di proba bilità sulle possibili continuazioni: • \"...un libro interessante\" → alta probabilità • \"...di studiare di più\" → alta probabilità • \"...vivamente di iscriversi\" → probabilità media • \"...il frigorifero blu\" → probabilità moltobassa Forma lmente, il modello stima: 푃 (푝푎푟표푙푎 푠푢푐푐푒푠푠푖푣푎 | 푐표푛푡푒푠푡표 푝푟푒푐푒푑푒푛푡푒) ovvero 푃(푤ᵢ | 푤ᵢ₋₁,푤ᵢ₋₂,...푤₁) 5.8.2 Token: l'unità di base I modelli linguistici non lavorano direttamente con le pa role, ma contoken: unità che possono essere parole intere, parti di parole o singoli ca ratteri. Ad esempio, \"insegna nte\" potrebbe essere un singolo token, mentre \"consiglia to\" potrebbe essere suddiviso in \"consigli\" + \"a to\".

5.9 Foundation Models Nel 2021, lo Stanford Institute for Huma n-Centered AI ha introdotto il termine foundation model per indica re modelli con ca ratteristiche specifiche: EMBA - strategia ed Internazionalizzazione 28 • Addestramento su scala massiva: miliardi di esempi da fonti eterogenee • apprendimento auto-supervisionato: il modello impara a prevedere parti ma ncanti dei dati (come la parola successiva ) senza bisogno di etichette manua li • Adattabilità: una volta addestra to, il modello può essere specia lizzato (fine-tuned) per compiti specifici conpochi esempi aggiuntivi • capacità multi-task: lo stesso modello può svolgere compiti diversi (traduzione, ria ssunto, risposta a domande, generazione di codice) Esempi di founda tion models: BERT, GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude, LLa MA, CLIP, Codex. 5.9.1 Pre-training e fine-tuning L'addestramento avviene tipicamente in duefasi: 1. Pre-training: il modello apprende da enormi quantità di testo generico, sviluppa ndo una \"conoscenza\" linguistica e fattua le di ba se. Questa fa se richiede risorse computa zionali enormi. 2. Fine-tuning: il modello viene affinato su da tispecifici o conistruzioni umane per renderlo più utile, sicuro e allinea to alle intenzioni degli utenti.

5.12 Scaling Laws\n#### 5.12.1 Leggi di scala: quanto grande deve essere un modello? Una delle scoperte più significa tivenello sviluppo degli LLM sono le scaling laws, leggi empiriche che descrivono come le prestazioni migliora no all'a umenta redelle risorse. Il pa per fondamentale di Kapla n et al. (2020) \"Scaling La ws for Neura l La ngua ge Models\" ha identifica totre fattori chiave: • Dimensione del modello: numero di pa rametri dellarete neura le • Dimensione del dataset: quantità di token usati per l'addestramento • Compute: potenza di calcolo impiega tanell'addestramento La relazione è loga ritmica: raddoppia ndo i parametri, le prestazioni migliora no in modo prevedibile ma conrendimenti decrescenti. Il principio fondamentale è che tutti e tre i fattori devono crescere insieme: un modello enorme addestra to su pochi dati, o un piccolo modello addestra to su dati vastissimi, non raggiungerà prestazioni ottima li. 5.12.2 L'aggiornamento Chinchilla (2022) Le sca ling la ws origina li sono state riviste significa tivamente nel 2022 dal pa per \"Chinchilla \" di Hoffma nnet al. (DeepMind). La scoperta chiave: i modelli precedenti erano sovradimensionati e sotto-addestrati. Le nuove leggi suggeriscono che pa rametri e token di addestramento dovrebbero crescere in proporzione simile. Il risulta topratico: Chinchilla, con 70 miliardi di pa rametri, ha supera toGPT-3 (175 miliardi) perché addestra to su moltipiù dati in proporzione allasua dimensione. Questo ha cambia to la strategia dell'industria: non basta a umentare i parametri, serve un bilanciamento ottima le tra dimensione del modello e quantità di

Il Modello di Business come Ponte Il docente presenta uno schema: tecnologia → IP Rights (intellectual property rights) → Modello di Business → innovazione Un modello di business risponde a quattro domande: • Che va lorecrei? • Per chi lo crei? • Come comunichi che sta i creando valore? • Come monetizzi?\n## 4. Tipologie di innovazione • innovazione incrementale: migliora un prodotto esistente senza cambia rne la funzione d'uso (es. penna BIC conimpugna tura ergonomica ) • innovazione radicale: cambia la ra gione per cui si acquista un prodotto (es. penna digita le Moleskine) • innovazione di prodotto vs di processo vs di posizionamento (la narra tiva )\n## 5.

Sintesi Finale La lezione costruisce un fra mework per pensa re all'innovazione: • La tecnologia è necessaria ma non sufficiente • Il modello di business è il meccanismo di traduzione tra tecnologia e valore per il cliente • L'innovazione è miglioramento dellavita delle persone (definizione di Floridi) • Il naming e il posizionamento sono integranti dellastrategia innova tiva • Le esternalità sono inevitabili: ogni tecnologia crea vincitori e perdenti, a lmeno nel breve periodo Il messa ggio di fondo è che chi si occupa di innovazionedeve pensare in modo sistemico - non basta a vere la tecnologia migliore, bisogna costruire l'ecosistema che permetta alle persone di estra rnevalore.

I PROGETTI DI RICERCA ATTUALI Il Legame tra tecnologia, innovazione e strategia Quello che faccio oggi è sostanzia lmente a ncora questo: cercare di capire il legameche c'è tra tecnologia, innovazione estrategia. Ed è quello che mi è statochiesto di prova re a racconta rvi. Per trova re il modo giusto di farlo, parto da due progetti di ricerca su cui sono attua lmente coinvolto - progetti che, chiaramente, influenza no la narrativa, la storia che racconto in cla sse. I due progetti principa li sono: uno sulla carne coltiva ta, tema scotta nte nel nostro Paese, e l'altrosull'impatto dei cambia menticlima ticisugli sport inverna li, altrotema molto scotta nte. Progetto \"Hot Snow\": Cambiamenti Climatici e Sport Invernali Partia mo dal secondo. Il progetto sichia ma Hot Snowed è condotto insieme alla Stockholm School of Economics, inizia lmente con la Fondazione Kahn. citano a nche, in parte, il Comita to Olimpico Interna ziona le, l'Università di Oxford e il King's College di Londra. L'idea di fondo è questa: gli scienziatici dicono che per rispondere a i cambia menticlima ticisi possono fare duecose - mitigazione e a da ttamento. Ogni azienda, ogniorganizzazione - semplice o complessa che sia - può, o meglio deve, reagire a i cambia menticlimatici. E può farlo attraverso mitigazione, a da ttamento, o entrambi.

Perché nessuno ma ngerebbe carnefatta solo di muscolo: sarebbe immasticabile. Il sa poreci viene dal grasso presente nellacarne - e nel pesce, in forma diversa, ma sempre dal grasso. Una volta seleziona te le cellule che mi servono, cosa faccio? Devofarle replica re in modo controlla to, all'interno di biorea ttori - una sorta di frigorifero al contra rio, che ma ntiene temperatura e umidità costanti, come nell'organismo a nima le: intorno a i 37 gra di, con il giusto grado di umidità ele stesse condizioni di crescita. Le faccio replica re. Poi devo metterle insieme. Ho bisogno di crea re un'intela iatura molecola re, uno scaffolding - sichia ma scaffolding technology.

Primo Hamburger Coltivato Nel 2013, Ma rk Post - ricercatore e professore di biologia molecola re, se non sbaglio, all'Università di Ma astricht nei Paesi Bassi - presenta a Londra, durante una conferenza affolla tissima (non c'era un postonea nche a pagarlo oro), il suo primo burger di carne tota lmente coltiva ta. Costostima to di quell'ha mburger: 250.000 sterline. Un po'troppo. Le Global Challenges e il Ruolodella Carne Coltivata Considera teche, quando diverse startup in giro per il mondoca pirono che era interessa nte la tecnologia che ESA e NASAsta va nosviluppa ndo - la in vitro cultivation - dissero: \"Guarda, questo potrebbe essere il modo per risolvere quelle che le Nazioni Unitechia ma noglobal challenges\". Perché? Perché siamo 8 miliardi e mezzo di persone; nel 2040 diventeremo 10 miliardi. Il livello non solo di a lfa betizzazione, ma di ricchezza globa le, cresce. Questo significa che chi oggi non ha accesso a proteine a nimali reclamerà l'accesso a proteine a nimali. È comprensibile. D’altra, la World Health Organization cidice che non dovremmo mangiare carnerossa più di una volta ognidue settimane. Non sto dicendo se faccia bene o ma le, però cambia re lo stile di vitadelle persone è qualcosa che richiede moltotempo. E convincere chi oggi non ha accesso a queltipo di proteine dicendogli: \"Guarda, non le ha i ma ngia te finora, meglio che non le ma ngi proprio\" - non è esattamente un discorso etico, d'accordo? E poi sa rebbe complica to convincere i norda merica ni, che consuma nocirca 10,5 kg di carnerossa al mese - quattro volte e mezzo rispetto a noi, cinque volte e mezzonoi. È molto difficile. Perché? Perché il consumo di carne rossa è simbolo di un'idea di

La chia miamo Clea n Mea t perché, se la chiamo così, chi va al supermercatoed è sensibile a i temi a mbienta li, chi vuole essere sostenibile, quando legge \"Clea n Mea t\" pensa a \"Clea n Energy\". Quindi \"Clea n Mea t\" è qualcosa che non tifa sentire ignora nteperché non ca piscicos'è \"in vitro\". Non richiede la conoscenza della metodologia.

Devi dimostra reche il prodotto è safe, non è harmful - sicuro, non da nnoso - e cosìvia. L'EFSA, in un anno, un anno e mezzo, ti dà il via libera.

La differenza fondamenta le è questa: • L'accademia ha come obiettivo la pubblicazione. Produce qualcosa di teorico, sviluppa tecnologia. • Ma l'accademia, di per sé, fa innovazione?

Non la compro più semplicemente per prendere appunti. La compro perché conquegli appunti voglio fare tantecose diverse - condividerli, a rchivia rli, elabora rli.

SCHEMA DELLE INNOVAZIONI L'innovazione di Prodotto e di Processo Rica pitolia mo lo schema complessivo. L'innovazionepuò essere: • Di prodotto o di servizio • Incrementa le o radica le Lo stesso va le per il processo e per il posizionamento. Se volete vederla in modo moltopratico, potete declina re: • Innovazioni incrementali: fare qualcosa che già sifa, ma farla meglio • Innovazioni radicali: creare qualcosa di nuovo al mondo EMBA - strategia ed Internazionalizzazione 58 Potete inoltre declina re l'innovazione in termini di componenti del sistema. Faccia mo un esempio: un'a utomobile è composta da diverse tecnologie. Sul pia neta, recentemente, abbiamo visto innova zionimolto diverse tra loro. Un conto è la biotecnologia - il gene editing che modifica lo stato genetico delle persone e incide profonda mentesulla vitauma na. Un altroconto è utilizza re la fibra di carbonio per le biciclette al postodell'alluminio. Chiaramente, la porta tadell'innovazione a livello di componenti del sistema è ben diversa neidue casi. domanda sullo Schema Studente: \"Nello schema, vedo che sivaverso l'innovazione passando da incrementale a radicale. Perché incrementale è più semplice? E nel caso del prodotto, c'è una logica particolare nell'ordine?\" In rea ltà non c'è una logica gera rchica nello schema. L'hanno costruito così per ragioni di visua lizzazione. Anch'io all'inizio hopensa to: \"Ma perché il prodotto va da incrementale a radicale mentre il processo sembra invertito?\" Poi, guarda ndolobene, sivede che è sempre: incrementa le-radica le, incrementa le-radica le.

un'altra.","keywords":["innovazione","processo","intelligenza","tecnologia","relazioni","azienda","prodotto","sistema"],"embedding":[0.03310653,-0.017669393,0.0250264,0.028924983,0.030465553,0.004102946,0.030654194,0.038860086,0.03329517,-0.061025426,0.049015272,-0.038514245,-0.07740577,0.040086254,-0.0032599557,0.034961503,0.012387439,-0.029475186,0.027651655,0.024397595,-0.00030457694,0.064892575,-0.0042994474,0.11752347,0.026629848,-0.052662335,-0.07363295,0.08784392,0.007463117,-0.030669915,0.031000037,-0.02051473,0.015201337,-0.07099197,0.023297187,0.062000073,-0.008378813,0.021505097,0.041595384,0.016003061,-0.087969676,-0.0069011236,0.0158773,0.044613644,0.04860655,-0.016726186,-0.034364138,-0.04112378,-0.047946304,0.049769837,0.0021752687,-0.11148695,0.0380112,-0.06665322,0.01429743,-0.05055584,0.004401628,0.0012703806,-0.014611833,0.0779717,0.03316941,-0.084637016,0.08300213,-0.016223144,-0.05844733,-0.017606512,-0.09457212,0.030952876,-0.07746865,-0.052630894,0.038042642,0.048134945,-0.055774912,0.051561926,-0.019697284,0.019209962,-0.030355513,-0.013236324,0.059642058,0.044613644,0.08331653,-0.050084237,0.018140996,-0.0029317986,-0.0056042154,0.032603487,-0.044959486,-0.038765766,-0.07331855,-0.03908017,-0.03140876,0.054391544,-0.03766536,0.04593413,0.010312386,0.0113027515,-0.03129872,0.0381684,0.04420492,0.020027407,0.04555685,0.009235559,0.04084082,0.035716068,0.016474664,-0.032572046,-0.008005461,-0.026519809,0.009620701,-0.06791083,-0.0413753,-0.025969604,-0.059359096,0.051499046,-0.060490943,-0.054485865,0.07878914,-0.052850977,0.019288562,-0.033358052,-0.018109554,-0.04102946,-0.09136522,0.005851807,-0.048417907,-0.0779717,0.008127292,0.058887493,0.035401665,-0.09211978,0.025576603,0.031330157,-0.035936147,-0.015444998,-0.0011505148,-0.103375375,0.013920148,0.0030772095,-0.008032971,0.09061065,0.022511182,-0.05178201,-0.029176505,-0.029632388,-0.04275867,0.024020312,0.032446288,0.030308353,0.022746984,-0.06017654,-0.09061065,-0.040180575,-0.025482282,0.08979321,0.038136963,0.005612076,-0.059704937,0.061119746,-0.0124031585,0.03316941,-0.04404772,-0.0043859077,-0.10243217,-0.0346471,0.00022830989,0.0010827219,0.011735055,0.006480611,-0.10130032,-0.047946304,-0.064012244,-0.026928531,-0.08664919,0.02845338,-0.010972629,-0.040809378,-0.0005497122,-0.05885605,0.029333707,0.0020848783,-0.03772824,0.040526416,0.0006381378,-0.08910152,-0.0056002857,-0.010367406,-0.107902765,0.060899667,-0.039048728,0.008080131,-0.03643919,0.02695997,0.0038101592,0.0039929054,0.09570397,-0.031424478,0.03156596,-0.03794832,0.06986012,-0.026331168,0.04455076,-0.015044135,0.03917449,-0.06659034,-0.0065513514,0.05366842,-0.031251557,0.023234308,-0.004535249,-0.019838765,-0.01733927,0.040306337,-0.002501461,0.042821553,-0.06159135,-0.0153192375,0.00936918,0.01417167,-0.0050854525,0.006637812,0.03310653,0.051656246,-0.038545683,0.09740174,0.0051797726,0.041155223,0.038860086,-0.016427504,0.0023560498,-0.04260147,0.025387961,-0.01744931,0.029129345,-0.03357813,0.02046757,-0.04574549,-0.021002052,-0.074764796,-0.0078050294,-0.029663827,-0.04084082,0.0152170565,-0.051373284,0.0789149,-0.03129872,0.03599903,0.02851626,-0.018706918,-0.07979523,0.016191702,-0.006649602,-0.0013519286,0.030166872,0.0002839443,0.035590306,-0.033012208,-0.019335723,0.023171427,0.07514208,0.05065016,-0.0028748133,0.060868226,-0.029726708,0.046751577,-0.04455076,-0.0018245141,0.0599879,0.02059333,0.026362607,-0.051404726,0.056026436,0.008378813,-0.038419925,0.020231768,-0.031220118,-0.023532989,-0.0314402,0.03643919,0.010697528,0.03782256,-0.046248533,-0.0284691,0.041972667,0.0284691,-0.010178764,0.049329672,0.04093514,0.060428064,0.030764235,-0.06306904,0.0065867216,0.021127814,0.01749647,-0.013652907,0.011546413,0.00945564,0.06652746,0.02042041,-0.063886486,0.02835906,0.015845861,0.0062290896,-0.017056309,0.03772824,-0.030072551,-0.0038573195,-0.052788094,-0.090987936,-0.019948807,-0.06495545,0.01565722,0.026849931,-0.002996644,-0.038954407,-0.008119431,-0.025387961,0.024869198,-0.039048728,0.018361077,-0.04093514,-0.055649154,-0.006158349,-0.0053330436,0.06564713,0.022841305,0.017072028,-0.012253818,0.003914305,0.08576886,0.024586236,-0.032855008,-0.0014472316,0.036470633,0.059610616,-0.048480786,0.01422669,-0.010249505,-0.045085248,0.030214032,-0.098344944,-0.0081430115,0.019272842,-0.030245472,-0.040086254,0.09325163,-0.034112617,-0.024711996,-0.08130436,0.037067994,0.036376312,0.008496714,0.010925469,0.027211493,-0.029129345,-0.013047683,0.095326684,-0.0026999272,0.062157273,0.059264775,-0.044959486,0.030795675,0.009109798,0.015248497,0.082310446,-0.035873268,-0.0131184235,-0.0022361842,-0.06325768,-0.052693773,-0.039205927,-0.01741787,-0.07702849,0.00117999,0.013409245,-0.0789149,0.016348904,-0.03348381,0.048229266,0.030575594,-0.023580149,0.07904066,0.039017286,-0.020876292,0.026268287,0.026284007,0.061056867,0.029019304,-0.024334714,-0.08840984,0.024806317,0.04844935,-0.03939457,-0.03936313,-0.005470595,-0.0021575836,0.012874762,0.01935144

IL CASO NOKIA VS APPLE La domanda sul Declino di Nokia Scommetto che molti di voi hanno a vuto uno di questi telefoni: il Nokia 3210 o il 3310. Il 3310 era indistruttibile. Ione a vevo uno: è caduto in ma re, l'hotira tofuori dopomezz'ora e funziona va meglio di prima. La mia domanda sull'innovazione è questa: perché Nokia non stapiù al suo posto? Perché io non ho uno sma rtphone Nokia? Perché tanti di voi hanno un Apple o altri ma rchi? Perché Nokia ha ma nca to il passaggio al nuovo sistema? Il Primo Smartphone Era Nokia Studente: \"Nel senso che quando è arrivato lo smartphone Nokia non ha capito?\" Non esa ttamente. Il primo sma rtphone l'ha fatto proprio Nokia. Il Nokia N40, N30, N31... Ioho a vuto l'N41, mipare, quando ero postdoc. Ero fierissimo del mio sma rtphone Nokia concui controlla vo le e-ma il - ci mettevo un po', la rete era quella che era, ma le controlla vo. C'era a nche il Bla ckBerry, certo. Ma il primosma rtphone commercia le di ma ssa è stato Nokia. Vi racconto una storia. Ero un giovane postdoc in Olanda, all'Università di Rotterda m. Il mio compagno di sta nzaera un ra gazzo londinese. Qualche settima naprima, Steve Jobs a veva presenta to il primo iPhone. Il Film su BlackBerry A proposito: c'è un bellissimo film che racconta la fine di Bla ckBerry ela sca la ta dell'iPhone. L'a vetevisto? Racconta come una semplice decisione - la tastiera touch invece di quella fisica - abbia cambia totutto. Bellissimo. Ci sono moltifilm che mostra no le dinamiche di come le aziende hanno usato la tecnologia per fa re business.

impossibile che qualcuno ciscalzi.\" Sbaglia ta l'assunzione. hanno fatto ma le i conti. Nokiaragionava: \"Continuiamo a dare tecnologia al mercato. Basta buttare dentrotecnologia e il mercato continuerà a comprare.\" Ma puoi spingere il merca to a comprare tecnologia solofino a un certo punto. Poi devi da re una giustificazione del perché dovrebbero compra re quella tecnologia. Che ci fanno conquella tecnologia? La differenza fondamentale Attenzione: ho comincia to a parlare di tecnologia. Non ho messo la parola innovazione. Questi di Apple hannocapito che perché la tecnologia diventa sse innovazione serviva un modello di business. Non basta va vendere il telefono e basta. Serviva un'architettura di business che permettesse a tantagente di co-creare valore per loro. Nokia invece: \"Faccio tuttoio.

Certo! Cipaghi prima, ci assicuri un certo livello di qualità. Se il livello di qualità matcha i nostri standard, dopoche ti abbiamo dato un pezzo del nostro software per svilupparci sopra, ti facciamo entrare nel mercato. Ti facciamo vendere l'app utilizzando il nostro sistema di pagamento.\" L'Osservazione sugli Incumbent Studente: \"È interessante notare che tutte le volte che un leader di mercato è stato spazzato via, non è stato spazzato via da un competitor preesistente, ma da un nuovo competitor venuto dal nulla.

Il touchscreen non è tecnologia Apple: è tecnologia milita re a merica na di vent'anniprima. I brevetti dentro l'iPhone? Applene ha pochissimi di suoi. Il design? Sì, Designed in California. Ma l'assembla ggio e moltadella tecnologia interna vengono da altrove. Non a caso, a nchenelle presentazioni attuali dei keynote, Applemette molto l'accento su cosa? Sulla tecnologia? Sugli ingegneri? Sul design? Sulla funziona lità? Sul consumatore al centro? Tutto questo, certo. Ma la differenza vera è stata il modello di business. Il Modello di Business come differenza È il modello di business che ha permesso alla tecnologia di diventa re innovazione. altrimenti, la tecnologia sarebbe rimasta un ottimo strumento per a ndare a fare la spesa - ma non a vrebbe cambia to il modo di relaziona rci, di comunicare, di vivere. Quindi, se dovessi schema tizzare: tecnologia → MODELLO DI BUSINESS + IP RIGHTS → innovazione In molti settori, per la tecnologia devoprima proteggerla con i brevetti.

Se lo chiedi a i ragazzi di oggi, pochisanno cos'è. Il problema è che la tecnologia VHS non era la migliore disponibile sul mercato. C'erano altredue a lterna tive: Video 2000 e Betamax.

faccio.","keywords":["tecnologia","innovazione","non","bicicletta","uso","hai","idrogeno","box"],"embedding":[0.045905717,-0.032277457,-0.041050304,0.03510978,0.09239997,-0.059442017,-0.05657291,0.046089634,0.083130546,-0.045758583,0.023670135,-0.041197438,-0.12462225,-0.0021230935,0.04895874,0.022401107,-0.040682472,-0.130949,0.011338491,0.027495611,0.03468677,0.09880029,0.016414605,-0.0078072823,0.008874002,-0.07761303,-0.0461632,-0.0030346327,0.017324993,-0.063708894,0.002830025,-0.03913757,0.011467233,-0.11064455,0.040976737,0.05454982,-0.024111537,-0.012708674,0.06462848,0.01003268,-0.10203723,-0.055359058,0.05730858,0.03921113,0.03531209,-0.040424988,0.027845055,0.0007098052,-0.073162235,0.06495953,0.0020253875,-0.041785974,-0.027550787,-0.019329691,0.029592266,-0.004496774,0.028304847,0.051460017,-0.0031817665,0.047708105,-0.026410501,-0.04785524,0.053409535,0.060030553,-0.050282944,0.093282774,-0.04414011,0.033436134,-0.064665265,-0.060067337,0.03650755,0.03422698,-0.03843868,-0.05267387,0.010501669,-0.019899834,0.002031135,-0.03231424,0.0363972,0.015918028,0.02414832,-0.023136776,-0.035275307,-0.03339935,0.0024874792,0.018704373,-0.056756828,-0.07290475,-0.04454473,-0.07982004,-0.08026144,0.013747806,-0.027973797,0.052342817,-0.01373861,-0.016626108,0.008175117,0.06804934,-0.006556646,0.006662398,0.06326749,-0.0013897239,0.089678,0.008483178,0.03691217,0.020138927,-0.032056756,-0.05024616,0.02403797,0.03371201,-0.021830965,-0.03292117,0.0049933502,0.088721626,-0.048112724,-0.0062531824,0.012156922,-0.0048462166,0.012276469,-0.02436902,-0.013867352,-0.012846612,-0.019587176,0.017324993,-0.018180208,-0.053372752,0.02081942,0.03542244,0.00794522,-0.051607147,0.030934863,0.032847602,-0.013002941,0.009039527,0.035698317,-0.013242034,-0.035183348,-0.039247915,-0.011706326,0.05999377,0.031541787,-0.041675624,0.029812967,0.00275186,-0.005857761,-0.017021531,0.0779073,-0.059442017,0.011016636,-0.017122686,-0.0010799385,-0.01691118,-0.024350628,0.06562164,0.040682472,0.0050899065,-0.040424988,0.04064569,-0.039064,0.032865994,-0.019384867,-0.02425867,-0.07275762,-0.021187253,-0.004423207,0.08938373,-0.022952858,-0.0652538,-0.09997735,-0.032774035,-0.048701257,-0.04241129,-0.0395054,0.049988676,0.0044714855,-0.02790023,0.040204287,-0.073051885,-0.000543705,-0.020138927,-0.029794576,0.03602937,-0.042668775,-0.057713196,-0.034374114,-0.06874823,-0.11093882,0.12359232,0.0047818455,0.010198205,-0.08533755,0.01890668,-0.014740959,0.08783882,0.086441055,-0.025932316,0.04013072,-0.0521589,0.063819245,0.024755247,0.080114305,-0.015090401,0.07665666,-0.016570933,0.016414605,0.06558485,-0.02747722,0.017095098,-0.015274318,-0.087176725,0.014189207,0.06315714,0.005011742,0.020249277,-0.080114305,-0.0074946233,-0.0001331244,0.027918622,-0.027219737,0.05315205,-0.026980644,0.020984946,-0.024663288,0.05024616,-0.009775196,0.038181197,0.012708674,0.012846612,-0.01400529,-0.009857958,0.009416557,0.02563805,-0.039652534,-0.042668775,-0.005774998,0.03005206,0.038696166,-0.030309545,-0.019329691,0.018364126,-0.0074624377,-0.017527303,0.03391432,0.01384896,0.005002546,0.012579932,-0.053593453,0.013122488,-0.004117445,0.06396638,-0.011035028,0.002572541,0.011301708,0.013435147,0.0073566856,-0.012736262,-0.08982513,0.036268458,0.057345364,-0.021481521,-0.007816479,0.05013581,-0.0037312189,0.044471163,-0.0712495,-0.00694747,0.0012506365,-0.0047059795,0.00033909723,-0.079599336,0.028599115,-0.0040875585,0.0079084365,0.068932146,0.027201345,0.016396213,-0.014419103,-0.0042117024,0.063708894,0.0046645985,-0.05870635,0.0324062,0.025178256,0.036323633,-0.019237733,0.06087657,0.075847425,0.046420686,0.02488399,-0.0705874,0.014317949,-0.0025886337,0.0068233255,-0.02727491,0.036765035,-0.055211924,0.0035725904,-0.03873295,-0.009103898,0.04476543,0.03400628,-0.06573199,0.046016067,0.01566974,-0.075038195,0.005512916,-0.0076601487,-0.021996489,0.0021460832,-0.074633576,0.0040070945,0.060361605,-0.038291547,-0.044986133,-0.01890668,-0.04402976,0.046751738,-0.08305698,0.03249816,-0.13683435,-0.00093855214,-0.01733419,-0.034631595,0.05440269,0.020892987,-0.038659383,0.04141814,-0.0020633205,0.001347193,-0.0004299063,-0.052821003,0.015651349,-0.05002546,-0.054034855,0.03038311,-0.004632413,-0.029132474,-0.00965565,-0.0028553135,-0.013996094,0.025509307,0.058117814,-0.03939505,-0.013278817,0.002074815,-0.0116787385,0.015412256,-0.03744553,-0.05539584,0.0594788,0.029334784,0.0049565667,0.040976737,-0.082174174,0.054696955,0.041271005,-0.051128965,0.06790221,-0.02026767,-0.03179927,-0.0141524235,0.101154424,0.020138927,0.111012384,-0.017996293,0.027955405,-0.033123475,0.009172867,-0.083645515,-0.0074808295,0.01369263,0.015200751,-0.042080242,0.015412256,0.0009805083,-0.07555316,0.08232131,0.044875782,0.018456085,-0.020046968,0.10306716,0.049657628,-0.05429234,0.0024277063,0.018051468,0.027311694,0.04134457,0.032056756,-0.04958406,-0.0053749783,0.02501273,-0.12278308,-0.08202704,-0.04774489,0.030327937,0.041822758,0.040939953,0.035698317,0.0037496106,

I MODELLI DI BUSINESS NON SONO BREVETTABI LI La Questione dei Brevetti I modelli di business non sono brevettabili. Nessuno si è ma i inventa to un brevetto sul modello di business. Neanche il processo di produzione, in sé, è brevettabile. Ciò che è brevetta biledeve essere: • creativo - devi dimostra reche è creativo • innovativo - nel senso di diverso dallo status quo, dalla conoscenza comune Se il processo utilizza una nuova tecnologia, allora la tecnologia è brevettabile - e il processo incorpora quel brevetto. Posso brevetta re diversi usidella tecnologia. L'Esempio della Teiera Faccia mo un esempio. Mi invento una teiera condue beccucci e dico: \"La teiera condue beccucci permette di ridurre il tempo di riempimento di due tazze di tè.\" È brevettabile? No. Perché la ma cchina del ca ffè condueeroga torifa già la stessa cosa. Quindi quell'idea non è innova tiva - non apporta niente di nuovo rispetto a ciò che esiste. Dovrei trovare una ra gione diversaper giustifica re il brevetto. Due beccucci nella teiera non basta no se la funzione è già rea lizzata da un altro prodotto.

Siamo partiti da ll'Ottocento: la bicicletta eracosì - una ruota grande da vanti, una piccola dietro, senzapeda li come li conoscia mo. Homesso questa storia per ragionare su un puntofondamentale: nel mondo dell'IT e oltre, l'innovazione di prodotto è spesso la ricombinazione di innovazioni provenienti da settori industriali diversi.

Due Approcci all'innovazione Questo è un approccio diverso rispetto a quello dell'IT: • Nell'IT: \"Ho la tecnologia, devo trovare una giustificazione per renderla innovazione - un modello di business, una piattaforma.\" • Nel mondo offline: spesso l'innovazione è l'adattamento di una tecnologia che non ha trova to applicazione in un settore, verso un settore diverso dove risolve un problema concreto. innovazione di Componente vs Architetturale Ogni prodotto può essere scomposto. quando parlo di innovazione, devoragionare: la nuova tecnologia impatta su un singolo componente oppure su tutta l'architettura del prodotto?

A Londra prendevo Bla Bla Ca r per sposta rmi dentro la città. A Roma a nche. Non ho potuto chia ma re Uber, hochia ma toBla Bla Car.

LA STORIA DELLA GRAPPA L'Influenza della Narrativa sulla Grappa Vi ma ndo un pa per moltobello scritto da due norda merica ni. Si intitola: \"How Cinderella Became Queen\" - Come Cenerentola diventò Regina. Oggi la grappa Nonino la trovi all'a eroporto di Tokyo. Negli anni'80, sociologi ed esperti del settore diceva no: \"La grappa non è paragonabile al peggior whisky, scotch o gin. È tuttoposto uguale sul mercato, ma di qualità inferiore.\" In rea ltà, la narra tiva concui sipresenta va la grappa era sempre stata quella di uno spirito loca le, che condensa va una conoscenza centenaria di una certa regione d'Italia. Il cui beneficio era limita to a quella zona geogra fica. Nessuna aspirazione a diventa re uno spirito bevuto in tutto il mondo. Il Cambiamento di Narrativa Poi qua lcuno - chi produceva il Picolit - cambiò versione. Cambiò narrativa.\"Sapete che il Picolit è il risultato di una particolare condizione del grappolo d'uva? Nascesolo in certe condizioni. C'è un processo dietro, la storia di una famiglia, generazioni di sapere...\" La gra ppa fupresenta ta in un pa io di conferenze europee e interna zionali sugli spirits conuna storia completamente rinnovata: \"Tustai bevendo un distillato di saperi centenari. Stai bevendo una prelibatezza. Se ne può produrre veramente poca. È un condensato di tradizione.\" Nel giro di dieci anni, la gra ppa è diventa ta uno spirito apprezza to a livello europeo.

LA TEORIA DELLA DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION (APPROFONDIMENTO) La Definizione Precisa di Christensen Passia mo a qualcosa che abbiamo nomina to ma non a ncora definito conprecisione. Christensen, al MIT, orma i 20-25 annifa, ha costruito una teoria: la Disruptive Innova tion Theory. A cosaserve? È nata nel momento in cui piccole realtà imprenditoria li, utilizza ndo la sca la bilità di processi e prodotti grazie all'IT, riusciva no a sma ntella re interi settori industria li e a caccia regli incumbent. Christensen ha detto: \"Dobbiamo codificare questo processo.\" La disruption theory studia il processo attraverso cui avviene la disruption - ovvero la caccia tadegli incumbent dal settore industria le. Uso Improprio del Termine Diffida teogni volta che qualcuno usa \"disruptive\" asproposito. Nel lingua ggio comune, \"disruptive\" è diventato sinonimo di \"qualcosa di nuovo\". Ma in realtà ha un significatomolto preciso. Le disruptive innova tion theory descrive ognisituazione in cui un settore industria le viene sconvolto (shaken up) e l'incumbent - l'azienda congra ndequota di mercato - vienemesso in crisi. I Due Tipi di innovazione: Sustaining e Disruptive Christensen distingue tra due tipi di innovazione: • Sustaining

Precisazioni di Christensen su Uber Studente: \"Come sitraduce disruption in italiano?\" È difficile. \"Dirompente\", \"stravolgente\"... di solito la la sciano come \"disruptive\" perché se cambi il termine perdi il significatospecifico. Come hanno Reagito i Black Cab? I blackca b hanno risposto: \"Ok, accettiamo le carte di credito, sviluppiamo un app.\" Ma fanno leva a nche sul fatto che se va i a Londra vuoi il viaggio iconico sul bla ckca b. Tifa i il selfie da vanti a Buckingha m Pa la ce con il ta xi dietro - e quello fadell’esperienza. Il Grafico della Disruption Il processo codifica to da Christensen è questo: Le sta rtup partono dal low-end market - la parte del merca to conbassa willingness topay, bassacapacità di spesa. Lo spostamento da quellow-endverso il mainstream market - dove si genera nopiù profitti - segue sempre lo stesso percorso. Studente: \"Non ho capito il grafico.\" La tra iettoria del disruptor: entra dal low-end ma rket e sa le. Gli incumbent non lo considera no - non sono interessa ti a quel segmento che pa gapoco. Accontenta rli costerebbe troppo, o comunque non pagherebbero ma ila cifra richiesta per il servizio premium. Mentre l'incumbent guarda altrove, il disruptor costruisce la sua ba se proprio su quelli che sono dimentica ti, non soddisfa tti. Chi ri da zero invece ha proprio quello come obiettivo. Infostrada È Disruptive? Studente: \"Neglianni'90, con la liberalizzazione delle telecomunicazioni ela fine del monopolio SIP, è stata lanciata Infostrada.

Il fondatore è il figlio di un a rmatore greco.

Il fondatore diceva: \"quando vaisull'autobus, tisei mai lamentato che non ti portano il panino? No. Staisull'autobus, non ti aspetti il panino.\" \"quando viaggi conNational Express - una compagnia di pullman - vuoi viaggiare a basso prezzo e in sicurezza. Non pretendi altro.\" \"Io non faccio altro che assicurarti un servizio di trasporto aereo a basso prezzo e sicuro. Nessun problema.\" Come lo assicuro? La mia logica di business, il va lore che creo - sia per Ryanairche per Ea syJet - è: trasporto no-frills. Le condizioni per accedere a quel tra sporto? Certo, a eroporti seconda ri.

DEFINIZIONI FONDAMENTALI Cos'è la tecnologia Abbiamo parlato di diverse tecnologie. Una è l'intelligenza artificiale. Quello che vedete là è il primo pa per pubblicato da Alan Turing nel 1950 su Mind. In quel pezzo, per la primavolta, staccò l'idea di \"essere intelligente\" dalla capacità di risolvere un problema. Per questo è considera to il padredell'intelligenza artificiale: il primo a separa re il concetto di capacità di risoluzione di un problema da ll'essere intelligente. Ci sono tante altre definizioni di intelligenza a rtificia le, e vari esempi di tecnologia - dalla blockcha in a molte altre. La Definizione di tecnologia Miserve definire cos'è la tecnologia. La definizione migliore viene da uno dei libripiù citati sul tema: \"The Giftsof Athena\" di Joel Mokyr, 2011, Princeton University Press. • \"La tecnologia è conoscenza - anche se non tutta la conoscenza è tecnologica.\" • \"La tecnologia, nellasua accezione più ampia, è la manipolazione della natura per un guadagno materiale umano.\" Questa è la definizione più utilizza ta. È applicabile a qua lunque cosagua rdiate: l'industria biomedica, il motore a vapore, qua lunque tecnologia. È l'utilizzo dell'intelligenza umana per manipolare la natura a proprio vantaggio o per un gua da gno ma teria le. tecnologia e Neutralità Tecnologica La tecnologia è una cosa diversa da ll'innovazione. La tecnologia ha implicazioni positive e negative.

CONCETTI DI strategia Definizione di strategia Devo mettere insieme un po'di cose: quello che sta dentro l'azienda e quello che sta fuori. Soltanto in quel modo riesco a formula re una strategia. Ovvio che poi i metodi per formula re le strategie - ovvero per decidere dove a ndare a competere - quelli bravifanno la PEST (Politica l Factors, Economic Factors, Socia l Factors, Technologica l Factors) a nalysis. Sifanno un ma tricione giga ntesco e dicono: \"Conviene entrare in quel business, in quel determina topaese? Sì, no, sì, no - pro e contro.\" Fanno un listone di condizioni che regola no l'ingresso all'interno di un settore in un determina to contesto geogra fico: fa vorevole o non fa vorevole. La strategia possia mo definirla come la determinazione di obiettivi di medio-lungo termine, realizzata attraverso l'adozione di courses of action e l'allocazione di risorse necessarie per raggiungere quegli obiettivi. Quindi: devo a ndare dal punto A al punto B, devo a veretutte le ca ratteristiche per poterlo fare.

Peròsoche c'è un monopolista che è incredibilmente inefficiente.

Lesson Learned - Vedere ciò che non sista cercando Vediamo ora un video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo: sitratta del celebre esperimento di Harvard sulla \"cecità da disattenzione\" (inattentional blindness). Nel video, ai partecipanti viene chiesto di contare i passaggi della squadra in bianco, e circa la metàdelle persone non nota una persona vestita da gorilla che attraversa la scena, siferma al centro, sibatte il petto e poi esce. L'esperimento dimostra come, quando siamo concentrati su un compito specifico, possiamo non vedere coseanche molto evidenti che accadono davanti ai nostri occhi. Ora vediamo un secondo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY: In questo video, oltre al gorilla che appare, ci sono altridue cambiamenti inaspettati che la maggior partedelle persone non

Questo confronto diventa il pa rametro di ba se per poter articolare quella conversazione tra gli indicatori, quindi, diventa lo strumento per poter riflettere.

Perché lo fanno? Lo fanno un po'per quella dimensione che vi dicevo prima di identifica re i fattori a bilita nti in termini di definizione del va lore ma a ncheperché riconoscono che queste sono dimensioni essenzia li per la loro competitività. Quindi se dovessimo pensare a d un report del capita le intellettua le come si costruisce? Si costruisce partendo da queste quattro ca tegorie e costruendo all'interno di queste ca tegorie dimensioni che ne misura no l'entità. Potremmo parlare a lungo ma non è su questo che vorrei sofferma rmiqua nto invece sul fatto che quando consideria mo i nuovi, le nuove dimensioni di competitività dell'organizzazione che è un po'il tema vero di questo semina rio, quali sono le dimensioni che determinano la competitività dell'organizzazione?

come le tecnologie internet based ma qua l è il ruolo dell'intelligenza a rtificia le che è il tema oggipiù caldo. Ma che cos'è l'intelligenza a rtificia le? È una trasformazione digita le? È uno strumento digita le? L'intelligenza artificiale non va visto come un nuovo strumento digitale ma va visto come un processo di trasformazione collettiva delle organizzazioni. Che significa? Significa che a differenza delle altre tecnologie che abbiamo utilizza tofino a d ora il ruolodell'intelligenza a rtificia le è che ci a iuta a d interpretare le informazioni. Esempio: siamo in un reparto produttivo, dove abbiamo tante schede tecniche per la ma nutenzione, per gli interventi. Abbiamo centina ia di schede guida e di procedure e c'è il responsa biledella qualità e guarda caso ognivolta che c'è un problema qualcuno alla produzione lo chia ma: scusi ma è dov'è la scheda tecnica per fa re questi interventi, scusa ma come si fa a fare questa cosa? no? perché? perché il responsabile ha la memoria storica. E'quello che a volte le procedure le ha scritte, è quello che le ha codifica te è quello che sta lì da 30 anni e si ricorda tutto di quell'azienda, si ricorda del progetto X, del problema che a veva a

Non è un impa tto che vedremo completa mentedoma ni, ma potete già inizia re asperimenta re. Io utilizzo sistematicamente l'AI a i primitre livelli: per interpretare, scrivere progetti, redigere documenti. Una tesi completa - con ca pitoli e analisi - la genera in cinque minuti. La capacità di calcolo edelaborazione di questi sistemi è impressiona nte; ognivolta rimango stupito. Natura lmente ci sono elementi da va lutare: il sistema può \"allucina re\", cioè produrre informa zionierra te. Bisogna verifica re la qualità dei dati e l'attendibilità dellefonti. Ma questa è la tra iettoria: grandi aziende stanno investendo, e il problema resta l'impatto sulle nostre realtà. - Lavori che scompaiono, produttività che aumenta - Le sta tistiche mostra nochemolti la vori sistanno perdendo.

La metafora di Atlas Mipiaceusa re la metafora del film Atlas su Netflix. Da una parte c'è un'intelligenza a rtificia le pura che, a vendo accesso allamente umana, conclude che il verovirus della Terra è l'uomo - e cerca di stermina rlo. Da ll'altraci sono esseri umanidota ti di esoscheletri collega ti al cervello: un'estensione dellecapacità della persona, non una sostituzione. Allafine, come in tutti i beifilm, vince l'uomo con l'esoscheletro. L'idea è questa: i sistemi di AI sono strumenti di aumentation - a umento dellacapacità cognitiva, non sostituzione. Come il righello, poi la calcolatrice, poi MATLAB, domani l'AI. Estende la nostra capacità di ragionamento, ma non la sostituisce del tutto.

Concettua lmente di più. • DIVERSA RILEVANZA In alcuni sistemi giuridici un contra tto che magari è statostipula to in un altro statoviene considera to un contratto internazionale con la conseguenza che si dovrebbe vedere se c’è una giurisdizione particolare o un diritto applicabile particolareed in altri sistemi invece, il ruolo di stipulazione del contra tto non rileva e quindi non è considera to un contra tto interna ziona le. Esempio: Ipotizzando di guardare solo l’aspetto giurisdizionale, immaginiamo di essere in un sistema giuridico S1 dove si afferma che il giudice competente è quello del luogo dove è statostipula to il contra tto. Quindi se stipulo il contra tto in S1 il giudice competente è quello di S1, se stipulo il contra tto in S3 il giudice competente è quello di S3. Il giudice di S1 a lza le ma ni affermando la non competenza su S3. Supponia moche in S3 viga la regola che il giudice è competente se le parti di rivolga no a lui quindi in S3 arrivaqua lcuno che vive in S3 allora il giudice S3 è competente. Sempre in S3 arriva un cittadino di S3 e uno di S1 che gli chiedono di risolvere una controversia. Il giudice di competenza è quello di S3. quale ordinamento è più a perto?

esso.","keywords":["implicita","strategia","internazionalizzazione","non","contra","diritto","roma","contratto"],"embedding":[-0.028767092,0.027121862,0.09369667,0.013984456,0.0054691685,0.004793158,-0.025835,-0.039420363,0.017055009,-0.025965314,-0.0037954317,-0.030265717,-0.015882172,0.031487424,-0.008446057,0.025313739,0.0073098713,0.0012990802,0.025623238,0.039159734,0.07603895,0.042873718,-0.029402379,-0.008022533,-0.07636474,-0.08020904,-0.025053108,0.026600601,0.006519835,-0.0062999283,0.057078082,-0.04199409,0.07851494,-0.076690525,-0.0048827496,-0.009529303,-0.023587061,0.022886617,-0.0070573855,0.004943835,0.039974205,-0.0367489,-0.0075460677,-0.019384393,-0.0858126,0.004638409,0.014774492,0.024857635,0.03841042,0.055579457,-0.027496519,-0.02058981,0.07401907,-0.020068549,-0.056947768,0.018504767,-0.02114365,0.08196829,0.049552374,0.006446533,-0.04065836,-0.07219465,0.03378423,-0.036390536,-0.082424395,0.07278107,-0.03932263,-0.0030277935,-0.043297242,-0.011150099,0.041277356,-0.028864829,0.05017137,-0.012950079,-0.021599753,0.008584517,0.018960869,0.066786565,0.07356296,0.029206906,0.04147283,0.007391318,-0.076560214,0.0047972305,0.007888145,-0.0032965688,-0.041049305,0.011907556,0.0047768685,0.02085044,-0.07818915,-0.043427557,-0.049324322,0.050366845,0.010653272,-0.090503946,-0.027822306,-0.05271252,0.007900362,0.03187837,0.041342515,-0.007908507,0.088744685,0.045936126,0.1242556,0.008951029,-0.056068137,-0.043590453,0.025183422,-0.0037078762,-0.030852137,0.07766789,0.07499643,0.013365459,0.023831403,-0.07603895,0.0152794635,0.022332776,-0.020215154,-0.11669731,0.010099432,-0.04056062,-0.045545183,0.02225133,0.048509855,-0.03132453,-0.005232972,0.022674855,-0.038443,-0.0896569,0.0875067,-0.006589065,0.019873077,-0.032546233,-0.049584955,0.05437404,0.066656254,0.04385108,-0.026209656,-0.0028221398,0.018781686,0.056459084,-0.030835846,0.08607323,-0.08737638,0.042091828,-0.019123763,-0.008869582,0.0030379745,0.023456745,-0.056361347,-0.032578815,0.004271897,0.01347134,0.038833946,-0.049747847,-0.05903281,0.017478533,0.055612035,0.032187868,-0.02775715,0.09369667,-0.038605895,0.0034472458,0.03323039,-0.028473884,-0.014399836,0.038540736,-0.07401907,0.06359384,-0.024075743,-0.06411511,-0.079427145,0.07265075,-0.02910917,-0.03463128,-0.03932263,0.078710414,0.07760274,0.0032741707,0.03599959,0.028571619,-0.040495466,-0.048477273,0.008812569,-0.03932263,-0.11005123,-0.014611598,-0.059945017,-0.014652321,0.028213253,0.02805036,0.05404825,0.03375165,-0.024254927,0.013398037,0.008222078,0.0747358,-0.05137679,0.030852137,0.04912885,-0.037400477,0.0050415713,0.011598058,-0.031422265,0.049552374,-0.06395221,0.066786565,0.01977534,0.022723723,-0.014554585,-0.07199918,-0.027040415,0.004528455,-0.05619845,-0.013357313,0.03847558,0.041863777,0.051800314,0.07102181,0.03371907,-0.05000848,-0.03508738,-0.009179081,-0.09382698,0.030070245,0.011198967,-0.01674551,-0.059716966,-0.0444375,0.07877557,0.051572263,-0.0335236,-0.043264665,0.02443411,-0.051409367,-0.016664064,-0.08209861,-0.06388705,0.053429253,-0.015556384,0.050399426,-0.020361759,-0.089331105,-0.022658564,-0.011695794,0.0046261917,-0.038540736,-0.050366845,0.020215154,0.04671802,0.02472732,0.05352699,-0.0042352458,-0.08985237,0.0022866256,0.090047844,-0.04971527,-0.0032497367,0.03762853,-0.019840498,0.0103682075,0.063496105,0.009781789,0.005416228,-0.05075779,0.0052044652,0.0030135403,0.04375335,-0.066395625,0.028669355,0.0048583155,0.044795867,0.01303967,-0.08939626,0.04346014,0.048184067,0.013780838,0.046001285,0.053917937,-0.0063732304,-0.011492177,0.035054803,0.030624084,-0.007643804,0.028066648,0.059423756,0.062421005,0.012388093,0.038312685,0.05978212,-0.047956012,0.072259806,-0.033344414,0.041212197,-0.01840703,0.026698338,-0.081707664,0.002557437,0.04864017,-0.046880912,0.058967654,0.024206059,0.003033902,-0.046848334,-0.013292156,-0.040267415,-0.04691349,0.032578815,-0.021257676,0.06310516,0.03850816,-0.030982452,-0.05763192,-0.019302947,-0.064049944,0.041049305,-0.022349065,0.052093524,-0.005965995,0.064049944,-0.02935351,0.01577629,0.047141545,-0.023391588,0.0124939745,0.0074198246,-0.030656664,0.037465636,0.006352869,-0.019009737,-0.017592559,0.05818576,-0.0061940467,-0.061411064,0.028604198,-0.012990802,0.03730274,0.036423113,0.017934637,-0.024320085,0.046261914,0.02446669,-0.029728167,0.03266026,-0.027040415,0.026437707,-0.05769708,0.036846638,-0.031145345,0.014831505,-0.06460379,-0.08555196,0.012542843,0.022365356,0.04069094,0.08685511,-0.06861098,-0.009024331,0.008389045,-0.028180674,-0.014261375,-0.029158039,0.024222348,-0.03847558,-0.06290969,0.003695659,0.023994297,0.041114464,-0.050953265,0.02774086,0.030575216,-0.100082114,0.0345987,0.0167618,-0.0011300776,-0.027398782,0.07577832,0.07831947,-0.06310516,0.0011555298,-0.00671938,-0.023684798,0.02363593,0.06978382,0.0604337,-0.047076385,0.020638678,0.021632332,0.005277768,-0.0433624,0.055351403,-0.014277665,0.059456334,-0.0014650285,-0.02115994,0.086464174,0.018537344,0.024368953,-0.0614

La distinzione di fondo è che i soggetti del primo gruppo (Enti internazionali / organizzazioni intergovernative) quando sviluppa no i loro modelli perseguono interessi che vanno al di là del business tra A e B esempio: AFRICAN vuole sviluppa re i sistemi economici a fricani e per questo fafina nziamenti alleinfra strutture dei pa esi a fricani (diga, ponte, stra da...) e questo è il suo primo obiettivo. Ma oltre a questo obiettivo ne persegue un altro ovvero, per lo sviluppo economico di una regione non servono solo le infra strutture ma devi a nche insegna re come fare le infra strutture (oltreche ma ngia re il pescedevi a nchesaper pesca re).

che la Corte di Cassazione si esprime in ta l senso: «Aifini della configurabilità di un definitivo vincolo contrattuale, è necessario che tra le parti sia raggiunta l'intesa su tutti gli elementi dell'accordo, non potendosene ravvisare pertanto la sussistenza là dove, raggiunta l'intesa solamente su quelli essenziali ed ancorché riportati in apposito documento, risulti rimessa ad un tempo successivo la determinazione degli elementi accessori. (non è detto che gli altri siano vincolati ed è molto probabile che quel LOI/MoU/Ts non siaaltro che una manifestazione dellostato delle discussioni tra le dueparti. È un tema estremamente scivoloso.) Pertanto, anche in presenza del completo ordinamento di un determinato assetto negoziale, può risultare integrato un atto meramente preparatorio di un futuro contratto, come tale non vincolante tra le parti, in difetto dell'attuale effettiva volontà delle medesime di considerare concluso il contratto, il cui accertamento, nel rispetto dei canoni ermeneutici di cui agliartt. 1362 c.c. ess., è rimesso alla valutazione del giudice di merito, incensurabile in cassazione ove sorretta da motivazione congrua ed immune da vizi logici e giuridici». [Cass. civ., 2 febbraio 2009, n. 2561] «L'indagine volta astabilire se e in che momento tra le partisi sia concluso un contratto, o se le dichiarazioni di volontà intercorse abbiano solo il valore di dichiarazione di intenti, costituisce accertamento di fatto, riservato al giudice di merito ove adeguatamente motivato».
