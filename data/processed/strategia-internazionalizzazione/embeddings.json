Andiamo ad analizzare un’analisi fatta nel 2010 negli USA che evidenzia le varie tipologie di lavoro presenti nel mercato del la voro: La voro ma nua le non routina rio Non-Routine Manual in nero. È il cla ssico la voro a rtigia na le. Come si vede da l grafico tende a diminuire ma rima ne sempre abba stanza costante, bassa ma rimane sempre.

Ciò che ca la in ma nieradrastica è il la voro routina rio ma nuale Routine Manual in gia lloperché l’automazione ela robotica , Industria 4.0 staporta ndo a d a utomatizza retutte le operazioni routina rie.

Si distingue da l knowledge flow, che invece rappresenta i flussi di conoscenza , ovvero come il sapere circola , sicrea e sitra sforma all'interno e all'esterno dell'organizzazione. L'esempio Swatch illustra bene questi concetti. Negli anni'70-'80 l'industria orologiera svizzera era in crisi profonda, tra volta da lla concorrenza gia pponese degli orologi a l quarzo economici. Le a ziende svizzere a vevano un enorme knowledge stocknella meccanica di precisione, ma questo sapere sembra va diventa to obsoleto. Nicola s Ha yek, con la creazione di Swatch, non abbandonò quel patrimonio di conoscenze ma lo ricombinò in modo innova tivo. Prese il knowledge stock esistente (competenze nellaminia turizzazione, nella precisione, nel design) e lo integrò connuove conoscenze (plastica , a utomazione, ma rketing dellamoda ).

L'ideaera che un progra mma per computer, a voltechia ma to \"a gente AI\", potesse imitare il modo in cui gli esseri umani pensano, ragiona no e intera giscono. • Il caso di Eliza. Creato da Joseph Weizenba um a l MIT nel 1966, è uno degli esempi più celebri di questa fa se. Il progra mma simula va un terapeuta rogersia no, ovvero uno psicotera peuta che segue l'approccio di Carl Rogers, basa tosull'ascolto empatico e sul riformula reciò che il pa ziente dice per stimola re la riflessione.

Ad esempio: Utente: \"Misento triste\" Eliza: \"Perché dici che tisenti triste?\" Utente: \"Miamadre micritica sempre\" Eliza: \"Parlami di più dellatua famiglia\" Perché fece scalpore.

5. Apprendimento\n Automatico - Machine Learning - ML Il Ma chine Learning è un campo interdisciplina reche integra sta tistica , informatica e ottimizzazione. Le sue origini risalgono a gli anni'50: il termine fuconia to da Arthur Samuel nel 1959, mentre tecniche pionieristiche come il perceptron di Rosenbla ttrisa lgono a l 1958. Dopodecenni di sviluppo teorico e a lterne fortune, il campo ha conosciuto una svolta nel 2012, quando la rete neura le AlexNet ha dimostra to la potenza del deep learning nella competizione Ima geNet. Da allora l'a dozione di queste tecniche è esplosa in ogni settore. La componente fondamenta le del ML sono i da ti, e il loro utilizzo solleva questioni crucia li: ➢ Qualidati servono? La qua lità , quantità e rappresenta tività dei da ti determina no l'effica cia del modello. ➢ Di chi sono i dati? Proprietà , privacy e consenso sono aspetti legali edetici imprescindibili. ➢ Come vengono usati? I da ti per genera re report a na litici ha nno requisiti diversi da quelli per addestra re sistemi che governa nolinee di produzione in tempo rea le. 5.1 Il principio dell'apprendimento da esempi Il Ma chine Learning sifonda sull'idea di apprendere da esempi per svolgere un compito (task). Invece di progra mmare esplicitamente le regole, si fornisce a l sistema un insieme di da ti (tra ining set) da cui essorica va a utonomamente i pattern necessa ri.

Il modello calcola una distribuzione di proba bilità sulle possibili continuazioni: • \"...un libro interessante\" → alta probabilità • \"...di studiare di più\" → alta probabilità • \"...vivamente di iscriversi\" → probabilità media • \"...il frigorifero blu\" → probabilità moltobassa Forma lmente, il modello stima : 푃 (푝푎푟표푙푎 푠푢푐푐푒푠푠푖푣푎  |  푐표푛푡푒푠푡표 푝푟푒푐푒푑푒푛푡푒) ovvero 푃(푤ᵢ  |  푤ᵢ₋₁,푤ᵢ₋₂,...푤₁) 5.8.2 Token: l'unità di base I modelli linguistici non la vorano direttamente con le pa role, ma contoken: unità che possono essere parole intere, parti di parole o singoli ca ratteri.

5.9 Foundation Models\n Nel 2021, lo Stanford Institute for Huma n-Centered AI ha introdotto il termine foundation model per indica re modelli con ca ratteristiche specifiche: \n[HEADER] EMBA - Strategia ed Internazionalizzazione 28\n • Addestramento su scala massiva: miliardi di esempi da fonti eterogenee • Apprendimento auto-supervisionato: il modello impara a prevedere parti ma ncanti dei da ti (come la parola successiva ) senza bisogno di etichette ma nua li • Adattabilità: una volta addestra to, il modello può essere specia lizzato (fine-tuned) per compiti specifici conpochi esempi aggiuntivi • Capacità multi-task: lo stesso modello può svolgere compiti diversi (tra duzione, ria ssunto, risposta a domande, generazione di codice) Esempi di founda tion models: BERT, GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude, LLa MA, CLIP, Codex. 5.9.1 Pre-training e fine-tuning L'addestramento avviene tipicamente in duefasi: 1. Pre-training: il modello apprende da enormi quantità di testo generico, sviluppa ndo una \"conoscenza\" linguistica e fattua le di ba se. Questa fa se richiede risorse computa zionali enormi. 2. Fine-tuning: il modello viene affinato su da tispecifici o conistruzioni umane per renderlo più utile, sicuro e allinea to alle intenzioni degli utenti.

I due progetti principa li sono: uno sulla carne coltiva ta , tema scotta nte nel nostro Paese, e l'a ltrosull'impatto dei cambia menticlima ticisugli sport inverna li, a ltrotema molto scotta nte.

L'idea di fondo è questa : gli scienziatici dicono che per rispondere a i cambia menticlima ticisi possono fare duecose - mitigazione e a da ttamento. Ogni a zienda , ogniorga nizzazione - semplice o complessa che sia - può, o meglio deve, reagire a i cambia menticlimatici. E può farlo attraverso mitigazione, a da ttamento, o entrambi.

Perché nessuno ma ngerebbe carnefatta solo di muscolo: sarebbe immasticabile. Il sa poreci viene da l grasso presente nellacarne - e nel pesce, in forma diversa , ma sempre da l grasso. Una volta seleziona te le cellule che mi servono, cosa faccio?

Primo Hamburger Coltivato Nel 2013, Ma rk Post - ricercatore e professore di biologia molecola re, se non sbaglio, all'Università di Ma astricht nei Paesi Bassi - presenta a Londra , durante una conferenza affolla tissima (non c'era un postonea nche a pagarlo oro), il suo primo burger di carne tota lmente coltiva ta . Costostima to di quell'ha mburger: 250.000 sterline. Un po'troppo. Le Global Challenges e il Ruolodella Carne Coltivata Considera teche, quando diverse startup in giro per il mondoca pirono che era interessa nte la tecnologia che ESA e NASAsta va nosviluppa ndo - la in vitro cultivation - dissero: \"Guarda , questo potrebbe essere il modo per risolvere quelle che le Nazioni Unitechia ma noglobal challenges\". Perché? Perché siamo 8 miliardi e mezzo di persone; nel 2040 diventeremo 10 miliardi. Il livello non solo di a lfa betizzazione, ma di ricchezza globa le, cresce. Questo significa che chi oggi non ha accesso a proteine a nimali reclamerà l'accesso a proteine a nimali. È comprensibile. D’altra, la World Health Organization cidice che non dovremmo mangiare carnerossa più di una volta ognidue settimane. Non sto dicendo se faccia bene o ma le, però cambia re lo stile di vitadelle persone è qualcosa che richiede moltotempo. E convincere chi oggi non ha accesso a queltipo di proteine dicendogli: \"Guarda , non le ha i ma ngia te finora , meglio che non le ma ngi proprio\" - non è esattamente un discorso etico, d'accordo? E poi sa rebbe complica to convincere i norda merica ni, che consuma nocirca 10,5 kg di carnerossa a l mese - quattro volte e mezzo rispetto a noi, cinque volte e mezzonoi. È molto difficile. Perché? Perché il consumo di carne rossa è simbolo di un'idea di mascolinità

Semplicissimo. La scoperta del fuoco, finché non ha trovato applicazione, non ha migliora to la vita di nessuno. Erapura invenzione.

La Differenza tra Accademia e Azienda Questo concetto lo trova teben a rticola to in \"Where Good Ideas Come From: The Seven Patterns of Innovation\" di Steven Johnson, pubblica to da Penguin. La differenza fondamenta le è questa : • L'accademia ha come obiettivo la pubblicazione. Produce qualcosa di teorico, sviluppa tecnologia . • Ma l'accademia , di per sé, fa innovazione?

Il Lato Oscuro Per il pianeta è un disa stro. Quella bandana finisce nel cassonetto dell'indifferenzia tadopo duemesi. Per produrre una semplice t-shirtbia nca servono circa 5.000 litri d'a cqua . Pensate quando qualcuno entra in una spira le di shopping compulsivo su Shein, o quando va da Primark edesce con un sacchettone di t-shirt che si rompono dopocinque giorni. Quanto le ha pagate? Un euro l'una . Ma conquell'euro, quanta gente riesce a essere paga taequamente? C'è da pa gare l'a cqua (5.000 litri), il cotone, la ma nodopera per raccoglierlo, la ma nutenzione delleinfra strutture idriche, chi produce la ma glietta , chi la tra sporta da lla fabbrica a l porto e da l porto a l negozio, l'elettricità del punto vendita , la cassiera che te la vende.

SCHEMA DELLE INNOVAZIONI\n L'Innovazione di Prodotto e di Processo Rica pitolia mo lo schema complessivo. L'innova zionepuò essere: • Di prodotto o di servizio • Incrementa le o radica le Lo stesso va le per il processo e per il posizionamento. Se volete vederla in modo moltopratico, potete declina re: • Innovazioni incrementali: fare qualcosa che già sifa , ma farla meglio • Innovazioni radicali: creare qualcosa di nuovo a l mondo \n[HEADER] EMBA - Strategia ed Internazionalizzazione 58\n Potete inoltre declina re l'innovazione in termini di componenti del sistema. Faccia mo un esempio: un'a utomobile è composta da diverse tecnologie. Sul pia neta , recentemente, abbiamo visto innova zionimolto diverse tra loro. Un conto è la biotecnologia - il gene editing che modifica lo sta to genetico delle persone e incide profonda mentesulla vitauma na. Un a ltroconto è utilizza re la fibra di carbonio per le biciclette a l postodell'alluminio. Chiaramente, la porta tadell'innovazione a livello di componenti del sistema è ben diversa neidue casi. Domanda sullo Schema Studente: \"Nello schema, vedo che sivaverso l'innovazione passando da incrementale a radicale. Perché incrementale è più semplice? E nel caso del prodotto, c'è una logica particolare nell'ordine?\" In rea ltà non c'è una logica gera rchica nello schema . L'ha nno costruito così per ragioni di visua lizzazione. Anch'io all'inizio hopensa to: \"Ma perché il prodotto va da incrementale a radicale mentre il processo sembra invertito?\" Poi, guarda ndolobene, sivede che è sempre: incrementa le-radica le, incrementa le-radica le.

IL CASO NOKIA VS APPLE La Domanda sul Declino di\n Nokia Scommetto che molti di voi ha nno a vuto uno di questi telefoni: il Nokia 3210 o il 3310. Il 3310 era indistruttibile. Ione a vevo uno: è caduto in ma re, l'hotira tofuori dopomezz'ora e funziona va meglio di prima . La mia domanda sull'innovazione è questa : perché Nokia non stapiù al suo posto? Perché io non ho uno sma rtphone Nokia ? Perché tanti di voi ha nno un Apple o a ltri ma rchi? Perché Nokia ha ma nca to il passaggio a l nuovo sistema ? Il Primo Smartphone Era Nokia Studente: \"Nel senso che quando è arrivato lo smartphone Nokia non ha capito?\" Non esa ttamente. Il primo sma rtphone l'ha fatto proprio Nokia . Il Nokia N40, N30, N31... Ioho a vuto l'N41, mipare, quando ero postdoc. Ero fierissimo del mio sma rtphone Nokia concui controlla vo le e-ma il - ci mettevo un po', la rete era quella che era , ma le controlla vo. C'era a nche il Bla ckBerry, certo. Ma il primosma rtphone commercia le di ma ssa è stato Nokia . Vi racconto una storia . Ero un giovane postdoc in Olanda , all'Università di Rotterda m. Il mio compagno di sta nzaera un ra gazzo londinese. Qualche settima naprima , Steve Jobs a veva presenta to il primo iPhone. Il Film su BlackBerry A proposito: c'è un bellissimo film che racconta la fine di Bla ckBerry ela sca la ta dell'iPhone. L'a vetevisto? Racconta come una semplice decisione - la tastiera touch invece di quella fisica - abbia cambia totutto. Bellissimo. Ci sono moltifilm che mostra no le dinamiche di come le a ziende ha nno usato la tecnologia per fa re business.

impossibile che qualcuno ciscalzi.\" Sbaglia ta l'assunzione. Ha nno fatto ma le i conti. Nokiara gionava : \"Continuiamo a dare tecnologia al mercato. Basta buttare dentrotecnologia e il mercato continuerà a comprare.\" Ma puoi spingere il merca to a comprare tecnologia solofino a un certo punto. Poi devi da re una giustificazione del perché dovrebbero compra re quella tecnologia . Che ci fanno conquella tecnologia ? La Differenza Fondamentale Attenzione: ho comincia to a parlare di tecnologia. Non ho messo la parola innovazione. Questi di Apple ha nnocapito che perché la tecnologia diventa sse innovazione serviva un modello di business. Non basta va vendere il telefono e basta . Serviva un'architettura di business che permettesse a tantagente di co-creare valore per loro. Nokia invece: \"Faccio tuttoio. Tido l'hardware, tido il software - Symbian, proprietario.\" C'eraqua lcuno che poteva sviluppa re app per Nokia ? No. Non concedeva nonulla di Symbia n. Apple invece: \"Vuoi creare app per noi? Certo! Cipaghi prima, ci assicuri un certo livello di qualità. Se il livello di qualità matcha i nostri standard, dopoche ti abbiamo dato un pezzo del nostro software per svilupparci sopra, ti facciamo entrare nel mercato. Ti facciamo vendere l'app utilizzando il nostro sistema di pagamento.\" L'Osservazione sugli Incumbent Studente: \"È interessante notare che tutte le volte che un leader di mercato è stato spazzato via, non è stato spazzato via da un competitor preesistente, ma da un nuovo competitor venuto dal nulla. Kodak dal digitale - da chi si occupava di elettronica di consumo. Blockbuster da Netflix.

I MODELLI DI BUSINESS NON SONO BREVETTABI LI La\n Questione dei Brevetti I modelli di business non sono brevettabili. Nessuno si è ma i inventa to un brevetto sul modello di business. Neanche il processo di produzione, in sé, è brevettabile. Ciò che è brevetta biledeve essere: • Creativo - devi dimostra reche è creativo • Innovativo - nel senso di diverso da llo status quo, da lla conoscenza comune Se il processo utilizza una nuova tecnologia , allora la tecnologia è brevettabile - e il processo incorpora quel brevetto. Posso brevetta re diversi usidella tecnologia . L'Esempio della Teiera Faccia mo un esempio. Mi invento una teiera condue beccucci e dico: \"La teiera condue beccucci permette di ridurre il tempo di riempimento di due tazze di tè.\" È brevettabile? No. Perché la ma cchina del ca ffè condueeroga torifa già la stessa cosa . Quindi quell'idea non è innova tiva - non apporta niente di nuovo rispetto a ciò che esiste. Dovrei trovare una ra gione diversa per giustifica re il brevetto. Due beccucci nella teiera non basta no se la funzione è già rea lizzata da un a ltro prodotto. \n[HEADER] EMBA - Strategia ed Internazionalizzazione 65\n 14. L'EVOLUZIONE DELLA BICICLETTA La Storia della Bicicletta Qui c'è un po'di storia sull'evoluzione della bicicletta come la conoscia mooggi. Siamo partiti da ll'Ottocento: la bicicletta eracosì - una ruota grande da vanti, una piccola dietro, senzapeda li come li conoscia mo. Homesso questa storia per ra gionare su un puntofonda mentale: nel mondo dell'IT e oltre, l'innovazione di prodotto è spesso la ricombinazione di innovazioni provenienti da settori industriali diversi.

Due Approcci all'Innovazione Questo è un approccio diverso rispetto a quello dell'IT: • Nell'IT: \"Ho la tecnologia, devo trovare una giustificazione per renderla innovazione - un modello di business, una piattaforma.\" • Nel mondo offline: spesso l'innovazione è l'adattamento di una tecnologia che non ha trova to applicazione in un settore, verso un settore diverso dove risolve un problema concreto. Innovazione di Componente vs Architetturale Ogni prodotto può essere scomposto. Quando parlo di innovazione, devora gionare: la nuova tecnologia impatta su un singolo componente oppure su tutta l'architettura del prodotto? È un ra gionamento un po'sofistica to, ma serve per puntua lizzare. L'Importanza del Nome Ne abbiamo già parla to con lo snurfer ela horseless carria ge.

LA STORIA DELLA GRAPPA\n L'Influenza della Narrativa sulla Grappa Vi ma ndo un pa per moltobello scritto da due norda merica ni. Si intitola : \"How Cinderella Became Queen\" - Come Cenerentola diventò Regina . Oggi la grappa Nonino la trovi all'a eroporto di Tokyo. Negli anni'80, sociologi ed esperti del settore diceva no: \"La grappa non è paragonabile al peggior whisky, scotch o gin. È tuttoposto uguale sul mercato, ma di qualità inferiore.\" In rea ltà , la narra tiva concui sipresenta va la grappa era sempre stata quella di uno spirito loca le, che condensa va una conoscenza centenaria di una certa regione d'Italia . Il cui beneficio era limita to a quella zona geogra fica . Nessuna aspirazione a diventa re uno spirito bevuto in tutto il mondo. Il Cambiamento di Narrativa Poi qua lcuno - chi produceva il Picolit - cambiò versione. Cambiò narrativa .\"Sapete che il Picolit è il risultato di una particolare condizione del grappolo d'uva? Nascesolo in certe condizioni. C'è un processo dietro, la storia di una famiglia, generazioni di sapere...\" La gra ppa fupresenta ta in un pa io di conferenze europee e interna zionali sugli spirits conuna storia completamente rinnovata: \"Tustai bevendo un distillato di saperi centenari. Stai bevendo una prelibatezza. Se ne può produrre veramente poca. È un condensato di tradizione.\" Nel giro di dieci anni, la gra ppa è diventa ta uno spirito apprezza to a livello europeo.

LA TEORIA DELLA DISRUPTIVE\n INNOVATION (APPROFONDIMENTO) La Definizione Precisa di Christensen Passia mo a qualcosa che abbiamo nomina to ma non a ncora definito conprecisione. Christensen, a l MIT, orma i 20-25 annifa , ha costruito una teoria : la Disruptive Innova tion Theory. A cosaserve? È nata nel momento in cui piccole realtà imprenditoria li, utilizza ndo la sca la bilità di processi e prodotti grazie all'IT, riusciva no a sma ntella re interi settori industria li e a caccia regli incumbent. Christensen ha detto: \"Dobbiamo codificare questo processo.\" La disruption theory studia il processo attraverso cui avviene la disruption - ovvero la caccia tadegli incumbent da l settore industria le. Uso Improprio del Termine Diffida teogni volta che qualcuno usa \"disruptive\" asproposito. Nel lingua ggio comune, \"disruptive\" è diventato sinonimo di \"qualcosa di nuovo\". Ma in realtà ha un significa tomolto preciso. Le disruptive innova tion theory descrive ognisituazione in cui un settore industria le viene sconvolto (shaken up) e l'incumbent - l'a zienda congra ndequota di mercato - vienemesso in crisi. I Due Tipi di Innovazione: Sustaining e Disruptive Christensen distingue tra due tipi di innovazione: • Sustaining

Precisazioni di Christensen su Uber Studente: \"Come sitraduce disruption in italiano?\" È difficile. \"Dirompente\", \"stravolgente\"... di solito la la sciano come \"disruptive\" perché se cambi il

Il Grafico della Disruption Il processo codifica to da Christensen è questo: Le sta rtup partono da l low-end market - la parte del merca to conbassa willingness topay, bassaca pacità di spesa . Lo spostamento da quellow-endverso il mainstream market - dove si genera nopiù profitti - segue sempre lo stesso percorso. Studente: \"Non ho capito il grafico.\" La tra iettoria del disruptor: entra da l low-end ma rket e sa le. Gli incumbent non lo considera no - non sono interessa ti a quel segmento che pa gapoco. Accontenta rli costerebbe troppo, o comunque non pagherebbero ma ila cifra richiesta per il servizio premium. Mentre l'incumbent guarda a ltrove, il disruptor costruisce la sua ba se proprio su quelli che sono dimentica ti, non soddisfa tti. Chi ri da zero invece ha proprio quello come obiettivo. Infostrada È Disruptive? Studente: \"Neglianni'90, con la liberalizzazione delle telecomunicazioni ela fine del monopolio SIP, è stata lanciata Infostrada.

Il fondatore diceva : \"Quando vaisull'autobus, tisei mai lamentato che non ti portano il panino? No. Staisull'autobus, non ti aspetti il panino.\" \"Quando viaggi conNational Express - una compagnia di pullman - vuoi viaggiare a basso prezzo e in sicurezza. Non pretendi altro.\" \"Io non faccio altro che assicurarti un servizio di trasporto aereo a basso prezzo e sicuro. Nessun problema.\" Come lo assicuro? La mia logica di business, il va lore che creo - sia per Ryanairche per Ea syJet - è: trasporto no-frills. Le condizioni per accedere a quel tra sporto? Certo, a eroporti seconda ri. Ma ti ciporto io - non devi impazzire per ca pire come arrivare a Southend o a Stansted. I primi biglietti li da vanopra ticamente gratis: un centesimo. Anche il bus per arrivare all'a eroporto eragra tis. Il Targeting della Generazione Erasmus Perché? Perché doveva nocrea re le condizioni per l'a dozione.

DEFINIZIONI FONDAMENTALI\n Cos'è la Tecnologia Abbiamo parlato di diverse tecnologie. Una è l'intelligenza artificiale. Quello che vedete là è il primo pa per pubblicato da Alan Turing nel 1950 su Mind. In quel pezzo, per la primavolta , staccò l'idea di \"essere intelligente\" da lla capacità di risolvere un problema . Per questo è considera to il padredell'intelligenza artificiale: il primo a separa re il concetto di ca pacità di risoluzione di un problema da ll'essere intelligente. Ci sono tante a ltre definizioni di intelligenza a rtificia le, e vari esempi di tecnologia - da lla blockcha in a molte a ltre. La Definizione di Tecnologia Miserve definire cos'è la tecnologia . La definizione migliore viene da uno dei libripiù citati sul tema : \"The Giftsof Athena\" di Joel Mokyr, 2011, Princeton University Press. • \"La tecnologia è conoscenza - anche se non tutta la conoscenza è tecnologica.\" • \"La tecnologia, nellasua accezione più ampia, è la manipolazione della natura per un guadagno materiale umano.\" Questa è la definizione più utilizza ta . È applicabile a qua lunque cosagua rdiate: l'industria biomedica , il motore a vapore, qua lunque tecnologia . È l'utilizzo dell'intelligenza umana per manipolare la natura a proprio vantaggio o per un gua da gno ma teria le. Tecnologia e Neutralità Tecnologica La tecnologia è una cosa diversa da ll'innovazione. La tecnologia ha implicazioni positive e negative. Per questo siparla di neutralità tecnologica: non c'è nessuno che può sostenere che una tecnologia siabuona o cattiva di per sé.","keywords":["tecnologia","intelligenza","definizione","tecnologica","definizioni"],"embedding":[0.03314281,-0.02421015,0.027561845,0.007751769,0.15389736,-0.046643123,-0.025394935,0.0011214537,0.036167126,-0.010320103,0.061920617,-0.0010415587,-0.10800253,-0.027935987,0.02894929,-0.024397222,-0.0023130593,-0.05247351,0.08655167,0.044897124,0.03760134,0.066659756,-0.061982974,0.04346291,0.034670558,-0.043774694,-0.002205883,0.033205163,-0.0000016555997,0.011567245,0.025971739,-0.013297655,0.047297873,-0.05799212,0.08281025,0.060392868,0.012611726,-0.010873522,-0.030960308,0.0359177,-0.049854513,-0.027421542,-0.02463106,0.033859912,0.036665983,-0.08954482,0.017163796,-0.014981297,-0.025800256,-0.009751094,-0.080627754,-0.08118896,-0.018130332,0.015074832,-0.007120403,0.008192166,0.020609027,0.037726056,-0.004485815,0.036198307,-0.033828735,0.013929021,0.035512377,0.01881626,-0.085741036,0.02982229,-0.084618606,-0.0002309162,-0.03956559,-0.0648514,0.034109343,0.077696964,-0.03501352,-0.0020889633,0.030773237,-0.027109757,-0.022417383,0.06229476,0.05166287,-0.0009967395,0.005327636,-0.030851183,-0.017787367,-0.0015579535,-0.0046611945,0.02205883,-0.060174618,-0.07451675,-0.10108089,-0.028466024,-0.051101655,-0.022386204,-0.0248649,0.051974658,-0.023945132,-0.062419474,0.07856996,0.042901695,-0.025379347,-0.0011789392,-0.004462431,0.04168573,0.0027826864,-0.012931307,0.02078051,-0.0674704,-0.030461451,-0.05665144,0.012221995,0.029791113,-0.04776555,-0.028045112,-0.014435672,0.034701735,-0.025036382,-0.07919354,0.0046650916,-0.017319689,0.012409066,-0.0044546365,-0.038754947,-0.026969453,0.026953863,-0.028528381,-0.026657667,-0.08542925,0.05855333,0.036759518,-0.028294541,-0.04860737,0.09428396,0.096591175,-0.052941192,-0.012167432,0.0018677905,-0.08692582,0.029276665,-0.02011017,0.03959677,0.004364998,0.026267935,-0.05253587,-0.018753903,0.04149866,0.03270631,-0.060673475,0.009735505,-0.011387968,0.04040741,0.03308045,-0.045957193,0.030352326,-0.010444817,0.04845148,0.012362299,0.012221995,0.017693833,0.068592824,-0.014084914,-0.03414052,0.0050860024,-0.015487948,-0.028871344,0.041186877,0.027686559,0.06896697,0.05253587,-0.0037628622,-0.05920808,-0.04090627,-0.052504692,-0.025051972,-0.111868665,0.06029933,0.026501775,0.023399508,-0.020219294,-0.014537003,-0.0030905746,-0.1094991,-0.07557683,0.07046354,-0.08237375,-0.039534412,0.0060369484,-0.023539811,-0.08786117,0.053252976,-0.012253174,0.014996886,-0.057867404,0.009213264,-0.00030788826,0.04025152,0.09864896,-0.03629184,0.0031256503,0.004033726,0.051070478,-0.03156829,0.065973826,-0.016509047,0.007884278,0.009649764,-0.015028065,0.04948037,0.057617974,0.08093954,-0.07570154,-0.0506028,0.0070736352,0.039222624,0.0540948,0.010733219,-0.113864094,0.008418211,-0.01883185,0.019159224,-0.027998345,0.06510083,-0.048794445,0.023742473,-0.07432968,0.08517982,-0.014357726,-0.009649764,-0.0037199918,0.020671384,0.012034924,-0.058241546,0.051132835,0.008542925,-0.030773237,-0.056495547,0.014342137,-0.02184058,0.008199961,-0.022386204,-0.027374774,0.0124714235,-0.006824207,-0.027343595,-0.03978384,0.059987545,-0.01858242,0.0067813364,0.020141348,-0.009680943,0.012159637,-0.00875338,0.034514662,-0.054843083,0.0665974,0.059800476,0.018691545,-0.03457702,-0.068904616,0.013905637,0.04221577,0.021310544,-0.07420497,-0.0069060507,-0.019564545,-0.030165255,-0.056994405,-0.008995014,0.029681988,0.0029775524,0.0037375297,-0.038443163,0.06722097,0.033859912,0.02313449,0.008574103,-0.040719196,-0.021217009,-0.06164001,-0.0029775524,0.011582835,0.07320725,-0.062138867,0.014404493,0.039004374,0.04845148,-0.0003100805,0.086426966,0.031007076,0.029136362,0.03438995,-0.04860737,0.023913953,0.038162556,0.053502407,-0.03152152,0.019517777,0.021824991,0.07875704,0.047640838,-0.062138867,-0.03785077,0.01587768,0.003150983,0.04059448,0.00022032036,-0.009384746,0.010857933,-0.050852228,-0.023493044,0.011310022,-0.022775937,0.053938907,-0.0031782642,-0.016072547,-0.028855756,-0.09366039,-0.048389122,-0.0070034834,-0.08081482,-0.027795684,-0.04103098,-0.00783751,0.0471108,0.0253014,0.03738309,0.013827691,0.0041623376,-0.008371443,0.06323011,0.0062474036,-0.017896492,-0.04698609,0.017023493,-0.0079973005,-0.038380805,-0.03414052,-0.0130872,-0.04059448,0.048108514,-0.060236976,-0.052161727,-0.019502187,-0.04109334,-0.053783014,-0.009992728,0.03351695,-0.02011017,-0.008893684,-0.08873418,0.05964458,0.08318439,0.037320733,-0.03694659,-0.014217422,-0.06416547,-0.061920617,0.08443154,-0.08443154,0.004692373,0.02986906,-0.047734372,0.005678395,0.040937446,0.042839337,0.049075052,-0.010109647,0.010343486,-0.06578676,-0.049885694,-0.06276244,-0.12496366,-0.06363544,-0.010023907,0.04863855,-0.011302227,-0.027764507,-0.03175536,-0.0051600514,0.038630232,0.01663376,-0.022308258,0.04732905,0.022978596,0.01990751,-0.065537326,0.00022446126,-0.015121601,0.016353155,-0.051974658,-0.04411766,-0.0035816368,0.10800253,-0.039316162,-0.048077337,-0.02140408,0.012299941,0.0155658955,-0.060049903,-0.008051863,0.

CONCETTI DI STRATEGIA Definizione di strategia\n Devo mettere insieme un po'di cose: quello che sta dentro l'a zienda e quello che sta fuori. Soltanto in quel modo riesco a formula re una strategia . Ovvio che poi i metodi per formula re le strategie - ovvero per decidere dove a ndare a competere - quelli bravifanno la PEST (Politica l Factors, Economic Factors, Socia l Factors, Technologica l Factors) a nalysis. Sifanno un ma tricione giga ntesco e dicono: \"Conviene entrare in quel business, in quel determina topaese? Sì, no, sì, no - pro e contro.\" Fanno un listone di condizioni che regola no l'ingresso all'interno di un settore in un determina to contesto geogra fico: fa vorevole o non fa vorevole. La stra tegia possia mo definirla come la determinazione di obiettivi di medio-lungo termine, realizzata attraverso l'adozione di courses of action e l'allocazione di risorse necessarie per raggiungere quegli obiettivi. Quindi: devo a ndare da l punto A a l punto B, devo a veretutte le ca ratteristiche per poterlo fare. Mi servono gli a erei, miserve il persona le di bordo, mi servono le a utorizza zionidell'ENAC, miserve un accordo commercia le con le piste di atterra ggiodegli a eroporti, mi servono tutte le cose che ho elenca to. E poi devo vedere se l'investimento lo posso fare - cioè, chi c'è fuori? I miei competitor mi permettono di fa re una roba del genere? Non me lo permettono? La legislazione europea me lo permette?

Nel video, ai partecipanti viene chiesto di contare i passaggi della squadra in bianco, e circa la metàdelle persone non nota una persona vestita da gorilla che attraversa la scena, siferma al centro, sibatte il petto e poi esce. L'esperimento dimostra come, quando siamo concentrati su un compito specifico, possiamo non vedere coseanche molto evidenti che accadono davanti ai nostri occhi. Ora vediamo un secondo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY: In questo video, oltre al gorilla che appare, ci sono altridue cambiamenti inaspettati che la maggior partedelle persone non

Perché lo fanno? Lo fanno un po'per quella dimensione che vi dicevo prima di identifica re i fattori a bilita nti in termini di definizione del va lore ma a ncheperché riconoscono che queste sono dimensioni essenzia li per la loro competitività . Quindi se dovessimo pensare a d un report del ca pita le intellettua le come si costruisce? Si costruisce partendo da queste quattro ca tegorie e costruendo all'interno di queste ca tegorie dimensioni che ne misura no l'entità . Potremmo parlare a lungo ma non è su questo che vorrei sofferma rmiqua nto invece sul fatto che qua ndo consideria mo i nuovi, le nuove dimensioni di competitività dell'organizzazione che è un po'il tema vero di questo semina rio, quali sono le dimensioni che determinano la competitività dell'organizzazione?

Di fatto l'organizzazione, sottoquesto aspetto da un punto di vista concettua le, può essere vista come un sistema cognitivo, cioè l'organizzazione apprende, è un sistema sociotecnico, dove abbiamo partesocia le e parte tecnologica che coesistono e coinvolgono in un processo di sviluppo.

è uno dei modelli dell'MIT (Capgemini) che definiscono come la tra sformazione digita le può essere implementa ta ma quello che io voglio mettere in evidenza non è tantooggi la tra sformazione digita

Ma che cos'è l'intelligenza a rtificia le? È una tra sformazione digita le? È uno strumento digita le? L'intelligenza artificiale non va visto come un nuovo strumento digitale ma va visto come un processo di trasformazione collettiva delle organizzazioni. Che significa ? Significa che a differenza delle a ltre tecnologie che abbiamo utilizza tofino a d ora il ruolodell'intelligenza a rtificia le è che ci a iuta a d interpreta re le informazioni. Esempio: siamo in un reparto produttivo, dove abbiamo tante schede tecniche per la ma nutenzione, per gli interventi. Abbiamo centina ia di schede guida e di procedure e c'è il responsa biledella qualità e guarda caso ognivolta che c'è un problema qualcuno alla produzione lo chia ma: scusi ma è dov'è la scheda tecnica per fa re questi interventi, scusa ma come si fa a fare questa cosa ? no? perché? perché il responsabile ha la memoria storica . E'quello che a volte le procedure le ha scritte, è quello che le ha codifica te è quello che sta lì da 30 anni e si ricorda tutto di quell'a zienda , si ricorda del progetto X, del problema che a veva

Concettua lmente di più. • DIVERSA RILEVANZA In a lcuni sistemi giuridici un contra tto che magari è sta tostipula to in un a ltro Statoviene considera to un contratto internazionale con la conseguenza che si dovrebbe vedere se c’è una giurisdizione particolare o un diritto applicabile particola reed in a ltri sistemi invece, il ruolo di stipulazione del contra tto non rileva e quindi non è considera to un contra tto interna ziona le. Esempio: Ipotizzando di guardare solo l’aspetto giurisdizionale, immaginiamo di essere in un sistema giuridico S1 dove si afferma che il giudice competente è quello del luogo dove è sta tostipula to il contra tto. Quindi se stipulo il contra tto in S1 il giudice competente è quello di S1, se stipulo il contra tto in S3 il giudice competente è quello di S3. Il giudice di S1 a lza le ma ni affermando la non competenza su S3. Supponia moche in S3 viga la regola che il giudice è competente se le parti di rivolga no a lui quindi in S3 arrivaqua lcuno che vive in S3 allora il giudice S3 è competente. Sempre in S3 arriva un cittadino di S3 e uno di S1 che gli chiedono di risolvere una controversia . Il giudice di competenza è quello di S3. Qua le ordinamento è più a perto?

esso.","keywords":["contra","diritto","contratto","ncese","regolamento"],"embedding":[-0.03013323,0.029235922,0.07570016,0.012244174,-0.00071988563,0.011355024,-0.03667542,-0.03612072,-0.0013826699,-0.033069875,-0.0048944065,-0.03497869,-0.025418285,0.02838756,-0.013247527,0.030851077,0.009943803,0.0021249882,0.031797327,0.033771407,0.07902835,0.045387466,-0.041145645,-0.0033526686,-0.06421462,-0.060429607,-0.027653398,0.015148189,0.002506344,-0.013051751,0.05240278,-0.042385563,0.08849087,-0.07413395,-0.011501856,-0.011665002,-0.039970987,0.0456485,-0.022334808,0.022220606,0.039514177,-0.051130235,-0.008605998,-0.0196592,-0.077723175,0.006909271,0.0062281326,0.025140936,0.04081935,0.05713404,-0.031829957,-0.026576629,0.08424906,-0.019773403,-0.062681034,0.010743222,-0.0150503,0.08333543,0.051097605,0.008557054,-0.049466137,-0.086989924,0.0052818805,-0.04137405,-0.086337335,0.0808556,-0.06180004,-0.0092504285,-0.04026465,-0.013084381,0.034228217,-0.019985493,0.05560046,-0.004052161,-0.015906822,-0.0025124622,0.009813285,0.060658015,0.077266365,0.02491253,0.037132233,0.011819992,-0.076809555,0.010580076,-0.00019004064,-0.010555604,-0.04032991,0.024618866,0.01243995,-0.007431341,-0.07067523,-0.042320304,-0.058504473,0.036544904,0.012807031,-0.08946975,-0.026544,-0.042157155,0.00497598,0.023705242,0.054197397,-0.017309885,0.084836386,0.037001714,0.119358264,0.004943351,-0.05781926,-0.022416383,0.02414574,-0.011558957,-0.026315594,0.07224144,0.08170396,0.025663005,0.02122541,-0.0794199,0.0153521225,0.020638082,-0.016363634,-0.11113566,-0.0044212807,-0.03572917,-0.05090183,0.0077331625,0.042646598,-0.025858782,0.008189973,0.029627476,-0.04202664,-0.08176922,0.09423365,-0.022367438,0.012855975,-0.044832766,-0.038111113,0.038078483,0.06904376,0.022122718,-0.012431793,-0.001231759,0.033477742,0.051684935,-0.03041058,0.08092086,-0.07517809,0.037980597,-0.04147194,-0.008214446,0.006884799,0.020034438,-0.05073868,-0.03277621,0.009992747,0.031895217,0.043592848,-0.04613794,-0.05670986,0.008850719,0.049988206,0.02915435,-0.04457173,0.09991115,-0.022090089,-0.006224054,0.03970995,-0.03680594,-0.014675063,0.03625124,-0.077005334,0.056253046,-0.016192328,-0.07367714,-0.084836386,0.078767315,-0.028746482,-0.03452188,-0.028240727,0.058896028,0.068847984,-0.0064075943,0.032482546,0.033412483,-0.053577438,-0.061082195,0.0018629335,-0.038013224,-0.10017219,-0.0030019027,-0.043951772,-0.009054652,0.03320039,0.014250881,0.04623583,0.01630653,-0.024945159,0.02049125,0.009968275,0.07047945,-0.034162957,0.021062264,0.047867298,-0.045387466,-0.00070459064,0.0063300994,-0.026902921,0.06398621,-0.07184989,0.07113204,0.027571823,0.01722831,-0.0022065616,-0.06799962,-0.022530586,0.0026531762,-0.063203104,0.0031691284,0.03928577,0.038241632,0.050608166,0.07217618,0.01868032,-0.054621577,-0.034848176,-0.008026827,-0.10454453,0.022595843,0.017244626,-0.0027592217,-0.05605727,-0.037915338,0.09110122,0.043201298,-0.04776941,-0.051195495,0.036479644,-0.042875003,-0.0008575408,-0.07602645,-0.067477554,0.04134142,-0.024520978,0.034782916,-0.012855975,-0.0860763,-0.017978787,-0.014968727,0.004690473,-0.03173207,-0.043560218,0.02755551,0.04137405,0.018109305,0.06326836,-0.007627117,-0.09410313,0.015857877,0.06659656,-0.038959477,-0.008654943,0.01840297,-0.023705242,0.01806036,0.043951772,0.01597208,0.010816638,-0.059907537,0.013614608,0.017962473,0.031503666,-0.067934364,0.02285688,0.0028530313,0.048487257,0.015768146,-0.08203026,0.04094987,0.050640795,0.015197133,0.05511102,0.04085198,-0.0008733457,-0.011403968,0.010392457,0.04561587,0.00011738929,0.033934552,0.050053466,0.059287578,-0.002771458,0.06323574,0.05785189,-0.045811646,0.075439125,-0.05237015,0.037686933,-0.030524783,0.020377047,-0.08503216,0.00053889456,0.043853883,-0.03267832,0.07198041,0.014895311,-0.0093727885,-0.054295287,0.0021637357,-0.040590946,-0.038992107,0.026380852,-0.025385655,0.06522612,0.024047852,-0.02285688,-0.042189784,-0.019806033,-0.07387291,0.036022834,-0.010849268,0.055274166,-0.014870839,0.067738585,-0.027702343,0.019381851,0.037589043,-0.020915432,0.009927488,0.010066163,-0.019593941,0.025760895,0.020540193,-0.017668808,-0.03553339,0.055730976,-0.014218251,-0.051815454,0.019593941,-0.009699083,0.0497598,0.03336354,0.032237824,-0.024814641,0.030671615,0.018761892,-0.041047756,0.02331369,-0.031193685,0.024047852,-0.050477646,0.04212453,-0.018272452,0.009242271,-0.06088642,-0.07302455,0.010278254,0.0323194,0.0231016,0.095277786,-0.063137844,-0.00077137887,0.00906281,-0.024765698,-0.014552702,-0.023705242,0.018990299,-0.027979692,-0.06294207,0.006631921,0.009054652,0.04450647,-0.04825885,0.0346524,0.03732801,-0.099780634,0.02359104,0.012276803,-0.013051751,-0.01809299,0.07015316,0.059287578,-0.08170396,0.005812108,0.00291829,-0.038111113,0.0026225862,0.07517809,0.056253046,-0.032237824,0.023248432,0.013704339,0.0068032253,-0.043168668,0.06127797,-0.012342062,0.054654207,0.0003492363,-0.015621315,0.10056374,0.016673611,0.033379853,-0.06620501,0.01532765,-0.05605727,0

La distinzione di fondo è che i soggetti del primo gruppo (Enti internazionali / Organizzazioni intergovernative) quando sviluppa no i loro modelli perseguono interessi che vanno a l di là del business tra A e B esempio: AFRICAN vuole sviluppa re i sistemi economici a fricani e per questo fafina nziamenti alleinfra strutture dei pa esi a fricani (diga , ponte, stra da ...) e questo è il suo primo obiettivo. Ma oltre a questo obiettivo ne persegue un a ltro ovvero, per lo sviluppo economico di una regione non servono solo le infra strutture ma devi a nche insegna re come fare le infra strutture (oltreche ma ngia re il pescedevi a nchesa per pesca re). Ecco allora che in questi modelli c'è scritto a nche che una certa % di la voratori deve essere composta da la voratori locali o che le imprese siano locali. Quindi se chiedo soldi allabanca a fricana dello sviluppo la banca a fricana michiede certecla usole.

che la Corte di Cassazione si esprime in ta l senso: «Aifini della configurabilità di un definitivo vincolo contrattuale, è necessario che tra le parti sia raggiunta l'intesa su tutti gli elementi dell'accordo, non potendosene ravvisare pertanto la sussistenza là dove, raggiunta l'intesa solamente su quelli essenziali ed ancorché riportati in apposito documento, risulti rimessa ad un tempo successivo la determinazione degli elementi accessori. (non è detto che gli altri siano vincolati ed è molto probabile che quel LOI/MoU/Ts non siaaltro che una manifestazione dellostato delle discussioni tra le dueparti. È un tema estremamente scivoloso.) Pertanto, anche in presenza del completo ordinamento di un determinato assetto negoziale, può risultare integrato un atto meramente preparatorio di un futuro contratto, come tale non vincolante tra le parti, in difetto dell'attuale effettiva volontà delle medesime di considerare concluso il contratto, il cui accertamento, nel rispetto dei canoni ermeneutici di cui agliartt. 1362 c.c. ess., è rimesso alla valutazione del giudice di merito, incensurabile in cassazione ove sorretta da motivazione congrua ed immune da vizi logici e giuridici». [Cass. civ., 2 febbraio 2009, n. 2561] «L'indagine volta astabilire se e in che momento tra le partisi sia concluso un contratto, o se le dichiarazioni di volontà intercorse abbiano solo il valore di dichiarazione di intenti, costituisce accertamento di fatto, riservato al giudice di merito ove adeguatamente motivato».
